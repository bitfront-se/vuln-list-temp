    "Description": "### Impact\n\nIf the `template` tag is allowed, its contents are not sanitized. The `template` tag is a special tag that does not usually render its contents, unless the `shadowrootmode` attribute is set to `open` or `closed`. \n\nThe lack of sanitization of the template tag brings up two bypasses:\n\n1. it is still possible to forcibly render the contents of a `\u003ctemplate\u003e` tag through mutation XSS. The DOM parsers in browsers such as Chromium have a node depth limit of 512 and tags which are beyond that depth are flattened. This in turn allows elements within `\u003ctemplate\u003e` (which are not sanitized) to be effectively 'popped out'. An example would look like this: `\u003cdiv\u003e[...]\u003ctemplate\u003e\u003cscript\u003ealert('xss')\u003c/script\u003e` where `[...]` denotes at least another 509 opening `\u003cdiv\u003e` tags.\n2. If in addition to the template tag, the `shadowrootmode` attribute is allowed through `sanitizer.AllowedAttributes.Add(\"shadowrootmode\");`, the simple payload of `\u003cdiv\u003e\u003ctemplate shadowrootmode=\"open\"\u003e\u003cscript\u003ealert('xss')\u003c/script\u003e` would bypass the sanitizer. This is because such usage of `\u003ctemplate\u003e` attaches a shadow root to its parent: `\u003cdiv\u003e`, and its contents will be rendered. \n\nNote that the default configuration is not affected because the `template` tag is disallowed by default.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe problem has been patched in versions [9.0.892](https://www.nuget.org/packages/HtmlSanitizer/9.0.892) and [9.1.893-beta](https://www.nuget.org/packages/HtmlSanitizer/9.1.893-beta).\n\n### Workarounds\n\nDisallow the `template` tag. It is disallowed by default.\n\n### Resources\n\nhttps://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/template",
