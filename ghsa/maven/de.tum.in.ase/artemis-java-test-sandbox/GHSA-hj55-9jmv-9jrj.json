This link is maintained to preserve external references.\n\n## Original Description\nArtemis Java Test Sandbox versions before 1.8.0 are vulnerable to a sandbox escape when an attacker includes class files in a package that Ares trusts. An attacker can abuse this issue to execute arbitrary Java when a victim executes the supposedly sandboxed code.",
