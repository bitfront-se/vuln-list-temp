    "Description": "A flaw was identified in the Docker v2 authentication endpoint of Keycloak, where tokens continue to be issued even after a Docker registry client has been administratively disabled. This means that turning the client “Enabled” setting to OFF does not fully prevent access. As a result, previously valid credentials can still be used to obtain authentication tokens. This weakens administrative controls and could allow unintended access to container registry resources.",
