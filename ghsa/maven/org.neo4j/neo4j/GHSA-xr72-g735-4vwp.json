    "Description": "Insufficient escaping of unicode characters in query log in Neo4j Enterprise and Community editions prior to 2026.01 can lead to XSS if the user opens the logs in a tool that treats them as HTML. There is no security impact on Neo4j products, but this advisory is released as a precaution to treat the logs as plain text if using versions prior to 2026.01.\n\nProof of concept exploit:  https://github.com/JoakimBulow/CVE-2026-1337",
