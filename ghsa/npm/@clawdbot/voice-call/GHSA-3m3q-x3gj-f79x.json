    "Description": "## Affected Packages / Versions\n\nThis issue affects the optional voice-call plugin only. It is not enabled by default; it only applies to installations where the plugin is installed and enabled.\n\n- Package: `@openclaw/voice-call`\n- Vulnerable versions: `\u003c 2026.2.3`\n- Patched versions: `\u003e= 2026.2.3`\n\nLegacy package name (if you are still using it):\n\n- Package: `@clawdbot/voice-call`\n- Vulnerable versions: `\u003c= 2026.1.24`\n- Patched versions: none published under this package name; migrate to `@openclaw/voice-call`\n\n## Summary\n\nIn certain reverse-proxy / forwarding setups, webhook verification can be bypassed if untrusted forwarded headers are accepted.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn external party may be able to send voice-call webhook requests that are accepted as valid, which can result in spoofed webhook events being processed.\n\n## Root Cause\n\nSome deployments implicitly trusted forwarded headers (for example `Forwarded` / `X-Forwarded-*`) when determining request properties used during webhook verification. If those headers are not overwritten by a trusted proxy, a client can supply them directly and influence verification.\n\n## Resolution\n\nIgnore forwarded headers by default unless explicitly trusted and allowlisted in configuration. Keep any loopback-only development bypass restricted to local development only. Upgrade to a patched version.\n\nIf you cannot upgrade immediately, strip `Forwarded` and `X-Forwarded-*` headers at the edge so clients cannot supply them directly.\n\n## Fix Commit(s)\n\n- `a749db9820eb6d6224032a5a34223d286d2dcc2f`\n\n## Credits\n\nThanks `@0x5t` for reporting.",
