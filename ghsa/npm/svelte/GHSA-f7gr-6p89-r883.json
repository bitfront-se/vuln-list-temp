    "Description": "Versions of svelte prior to 5.51.5 are vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) during server-side rendering. When using spread syntax to render attributes from untrusted data, event handler properties are included in the rendered HTML output. If an application spreads user-controlled or external data as element attributes, an attacker can inject malicious event handlers that execute in victims' browsers.",
