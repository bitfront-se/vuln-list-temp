    "Description": "### Impact\nThe Express server uses `express.json()` without a size limit, which can allow attackers to send extremely large request bodies. This may lead to excessive memory usage, degraded performance, or process crashes, resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS). Any application using the JSON parser without limits and exposed to untrusted clients is affected.\n\n### Patches\nThis issue is not a flaw in Express itself but in configuration. Users should set a request-size limit when enabling the JSON body parser. For example:\n`app.use(express.json({ limit: \"100kb\" }));`\n\n### Workarounds\nUsers can mitigate the issue without upgrading by:\n- Adding a `limit` option to the JSON parser\n- Implementing rate limiting at the application or reverse-proxy level\n- Rejecting unusually large requests before parsing\n- Using a reverse proxy (such as NGINX) to enforce maximum request body sizes",
