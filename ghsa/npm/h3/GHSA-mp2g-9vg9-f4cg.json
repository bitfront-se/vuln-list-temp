    "Description": "I was digging into h3 v1 (specifically v1.15.4) and found a critical HTTP Request Smuggling vulnerability.\n\nBasically, `readRawBody` is doing a strict case-sensitive check for the Transfer-Encoding header. It explicitly looks for \"chunked\", but per the RFC, this header should be case-insensitive.\n\n**The Bug**: If I send a request with Transfer-Encoding: ChuNked (mixed case), h3 misses it. Since it doesn't see \"chunked\" and there's no Content-Length, it assumes the body is empty and processes the request immediately.\n\nThis leaves the actual body sitting on the socket, which triggers a classic TE.TE Desync (Request Smuggling) if the app is running behind a Layer 4 proxy or anything that doesn't normalize headers (like AWS NLB or Node proxies).\n\n**Vulnerable Code** (`src/utils/body.ts`):\n\n```js\nif (\n    !Number.parseInt(event.node.req.headers[\"content-length\"] || \"\") \u0026\u0026\n    !String(event.node.req.headers[\"transfer-encoding\"] ?? \"\")\n      .split(\",\")\n      .map((e) =\u003e e.trim())\n      .filter(Boolean)\n      .includes(\"chunked\") // \u003c--- This is the issue. \"ChuNkEd\" returns false here.\n  ) {\n    return Promise.resolve(undefined);\n  }\n```\n\nI verified this locally:\n\n- Sent a `Transfer-Encoding: ChunKed` request without a closing 0 chunk.\n- Express hangs (correctly waiting for data).\n- h3 responds immediately (vulnerable, thinks body is length 0).\n\n**Impact**: Since H3/Nuxt/Nitro is often used in containerized setups behind TCP load balancers, an attacker can use this to smuggle requests past WAFs or desynchronize the socket to poison other users' connections.\n\n**Fix**: Just need to normalize the header value before checking: ` .map((e) =\u003e e.trim().toLowerCase())`",
