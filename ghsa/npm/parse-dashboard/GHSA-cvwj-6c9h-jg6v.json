    "Description": "### Impact\n\nThe AI Agent API endpoint (`POST /apps/:appId/agent`) does not enforce authorization. Authenticated users scoped to specific apps can access any other app's agent endpoint by changing the app ID in the URL. Read-only users are given the full master key instead of the read-only master key and can supply write permissions in the request body to perform write and delete operations.\n\nAffected are only dashboards with `agent` configuration enabled.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe fix adds per-app authorization checks and restricts read-only users to the `readOnlyMasterKey` with write permissions stripped server-side.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nRemove the `agent` configuration block from your dashboard configuration. Dashboards without an `agent` config are not affected.\n\n### Resources\n\n- GitHub advisory: https://github.com/parse-community/parse-dashboard/security/advisories/GHSA-cvwj-6c9h-jg6v\n- Fixed in: https://github.com/parse-community/parse-dashboard/releases/tag/9.0.0-alpha.8",
