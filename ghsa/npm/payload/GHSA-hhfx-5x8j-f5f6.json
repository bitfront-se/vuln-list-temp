    "Description": "### Impact\n\nA Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists in Payload's external file upload functionality. When processing external URLs for file uploads, insufficient validation of HTTP redirects could allow an authenticated attacker to access internal network resources.\n\n**Users are affected if ALL of these are true**:\n\n- Payload version \u003c v3.75.0\n- At least one collection with `upload` enabled\n- A user has `create` access to that upload-enabled collection\n\nAn authenticated user with upload collection write permissions could potentially access internal services. Response content from internal services could be retrieved through the application.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis vulnerability has been patched in v3.75.0. Users should upgrade to v3.75.0 or later.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf users cannot upgrade immediately, they can mitigate this vulnerability by disabling external file uploads via the `disableExternalFile` upload collection option, or by restricting `create` access on upload-enabled collections to **trusted users only**.",
