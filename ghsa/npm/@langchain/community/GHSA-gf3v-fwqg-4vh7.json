    "Description": "## Description\n\nThe `RecursiveUrlLoader` class in `@langchain/community` is a web crawler that recursively follows links from a starting URL. Its `preventOutside` option (enabled by default) is intended to restrict crawling to the same site as the base URL.\n\nThe implementation used `String.startsWith()` to compare URLs, which does not perform semantic URL validation. An attacker who controls content on a crawled page could include links to domains that share a string prefix with the target (e.g., `https://example.com.attacker.com` passes a `startsWith` check against `https://example.com`), causing the crawler to follow links to attacker-controlled or internal infrastructure.\n\nAdditionally, the crawler performed no validation against private or reserved IP addresses. A crawled page could include links targeting cloud metadata services (`169.254.169.254`), localhost, or RFC 1918 addresses, and the crawler would fetch them without restriction.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker who can influence the content of a page being crawled (e.g., by placing a link on a public-facing page, forum, or user-generated content) could cause the crawler to:\n\n- Fetch cloud instance metadata (AWS, GCP, Azure), potentially exposing IAM credentials and session tokens\n- Access internal services on private networks (`10.x`, `172.16.x`, `192.168.x`)\n- Connect to localhost services\n- Exfiltrate response data via attacker-controlled redirect chains\n\nThis is exploitable in any environment where `RecursiveUrlLoader` runs on infrastructure with access to cloud metadata or internal services — which includes most cloud-hosted deployments.\n\n## Resolution\n\nTwo changes were made:\n\n1. **Origin comparison replaced.** The `startsWith` check was replaced with a strict origin comparison using the URL API (`new URL(link).origin === new URL(baseUrl).origin`). This correctly validates scheme, hostname, and port as a unit, preventing subdomain-based bypasses.\n\n2. **SSRF validation added to all fetch operations.** A new URL validation module (`@langchain/core/utils/ssrf`) was introduced and applied before every outbound fetch in the crawler. This blocks requests to:\n   - **Cloud metadata endpoints:** `169.254.169.254`, `169.254.170.2`, `100.100.100.200`, `metadata.google.internal`, and related hostnames\n   - **Private IP ranges:** `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`, `127.0.0.0/8`, `169.254.0.0/16`\n   - **IPv6 equivalents:** `::1`, `fc00::/7`, `fe80::/10`\n   - **Non-HTTP/HTTPS schemes** (`file:`, `ftp:`, `javascript:`, etc.)\n\nCloud metadata endpoints are unconditionally blocked and cannot be overridden.\n\n## Workarounds\n\nUsers who cannot upgrade immediately should avoid using `RecursiveUrlLoader` on untrusted or user-influenced content, or should run the crawler in a network environment without access to cloud metadata or internal services.",
