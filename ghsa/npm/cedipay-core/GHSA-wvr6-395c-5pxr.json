    "Description": "A vulnerability in CediPay allows attackers to bypass input validation in the transaction API.\n\nAffected users: All deployments running versions prior to the patched release.\n\nRisk: Exploitation could result in unauthorized transactions, exposure of sensitive financial data, and compromise of payment integrity.\n\nSeverity: High — potential financial loss and reputational damage.\n\nPatches\nThe issue has been fixed in version 1.2.3.\n\nUsers should upgrade to 1.2.3 or later immediately.\n\nAll versions earlier than 1.2.3 remain vulnerable.\n\nWorkarounds\nIf upgrading is not immediately possible:\n\nRestrict API access to trusted networks or IP ranges.\n\nEnforce strict input validation at the application layer.\n\nMonitor transaction logs for anomalies or suspicious activity.\n\nThese mitigations reduce exposure but do not fully eliminate the vulnerability.\n\nReferences\nOWASP Input Validation Guidelines (owasp.org in Bing)\n\nCWE-20: Improper Input Validation\n\nGitHub Security Advisory Documentation (docs.github.com in Bing)",
