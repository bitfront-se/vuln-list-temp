    "Description": "Claude Code failed to properly validate directory changes when combined with write operations to protected folders. By using the `cd` command to navigate into sensitive directories like `.claude`, it was possible to bypass write protection and create or modify files without user confirmation. Reliably exploiting this required the ability to add untrusted content into a Claude Code context window. \n\nUsers on standard Claude Code auto-update received this fix automatically. Users performing manual updates are advised to update to the latest version.\n\nAbout\nClaude Code thanks hackerone.com/nil221 for reporting this issue!",
