    "Description": "Claude Code contained insufficient URL validation in its trusted domain verification mechanism for WebFetch requests. The application used a `startsWith()` function to validate trusted domains (e.g., `docs.python.org`, `modelcontextprotocol.io`), this could have enabled attackers to register domains like `modelcontextprotocol.io.example.com` that would pass validation. This could enable automatic requests to attacker-controlled domains without user consent, potentially leading to data exfiltration. \n\nUsers on standard Claude Code auto-update have received this fix already. Users performing manual updates are advised to update to the latest version.\n\nThank you to hackerone.com/47sid-praetorian for reporting this issue!",
