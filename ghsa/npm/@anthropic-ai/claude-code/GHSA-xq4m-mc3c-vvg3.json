    "Description": "Due to errors in parsing shell commands related to $IFS and short CLI flags, it was possible to bypass the Claude Code read-only validation and trigger arbitrary code execution. Reliably exploiting this requires the ability to add untrusted content into a Claude Code context window.\n\nUsers on standard Claude Code auto-update have received this fix already. Users performing manual updates are advised to update to the latest version.\n\nThank you to [RyotaK](hxxps://ryotak.net) from [GMO Flatt Security Inc.](hxxps://flatt.tech/en/) for reporting this issue!",
