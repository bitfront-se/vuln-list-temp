    "Description": "### Impact \nA Command Injection vulnerability in godot-mcp allows remote code execution. The `executeOperation` function passed user-controlled input (e.g., `projectPath`) directly to `exec()`, which spawns a shell. An attacker could inject shell metacharacters like `$(command)` or `\u0026calc` to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the MCP server process. \n\nThis affects any tool that accepts `projectPath`, including `create_scene`, `add_node`, `load_sprite`, and others. \n\n### Patches \nFixed in version 0.1.1 by switching from `exec()` to `execFile()`, which does not invoke a shell. \n\n### Workarounds \nNone. Users should upgrade immediately. \n\n### Resources\n - https://github.com/Coding-Solo/godot-mcp/issues/64\n - https://github.com/Coding-Solo/godot-mcp/pull/67",
