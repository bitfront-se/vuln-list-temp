    "Description": "## Summary\n\nThe `basicAuth` and `bearerAuth` middlewares previously used a comparison that was not fully timing-safe.\n\nThe `timingSafeEqual` function used normal string equality (`===`) when comparing hash values. This comparison may stop early if values differ, which can theoretically cause small timing differences.\n\nThe implementation has been updated to use a safer comparison method.\n\n\n## Details\n\nThe issue was caused by the use of normal string equality (`===`) when comparing hash values inside the `timingSafeEqual` function.\n\nIn JavaScript, string comparison may stop as soon as a difference is found. This means the comparison time can slightly vary depending on how many characters match.\n\nUnder very specific and controlled conditions, this behavior could theoretically allow timing-based analysis.\n\nThe implementation has been updated to:\n\n- Avoid early termination during comparison\n- Use a constant-time-style comparison method\n\n## Impact\n\nThis issue is unlikely to be exploited in normal environments.\n\nIt may only be relevant in highly controlled situations where precise timing measurements are possible.\n\nThis change is considered a security hardening improvement. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version.",
