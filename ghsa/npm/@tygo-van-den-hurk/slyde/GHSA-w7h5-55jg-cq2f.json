    "Description": "### Impact\nThis is a **remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability**. Node.js automatically imports `**/*.plugin.{js,mjs}` files including those from `node_modules`, so any malicious package with a `.plugin.js` file could execute arbitrary code when installed or required. **All projects using this loading behavior are affected**, especially those installing untrusted packages.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue has been **patched in v0.0.5**. Users should upgrade to **v0.0.5 or later** to mitigate the vulnerability.\n\n### Workarounds\n- Audit and restrict which packages are installed in `node_modules`.\n\n### References\n- [CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/94.html)  \n- GitHub Security Advisories documentation: [https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories)",
