    "Description": "### Summary\n\nA Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability (CWE-400) exists in the multipart file handling logic of `@adonisjs/bodyparser`. When processing file uploads, the multipart parser may accumulate an unbounded amount of data in memory while attempting to detect file types, potentially leading to excessive memory consumption and process termination.\n\nThis issue affects applications that accept `multipart/form-data` uploads using affected versions of `@adonisjs/bodyparser`.\n\n### Details\n\nAdonisJS parses `multipart/form-data` requests using the BodyParser package. During file uploads, the multipart parser attempts to detect the uploaded file type by accumulating incoming chunks in an internal buffer to perform magic number detection.\n\nThe internal buffer used for this detection does not enforce a maximum size and is not protected by a timeout or early termination condition. If the uploaded data does not match any supported file signatures, the buffer continues to grow as more chunks are received.\n\nWhen certain configurations are used, such as deferred validations or permissive file size limits, this buffering behavior may persist for the duration of the upload stream.\n\n### Impact\n\nExploitation requires a reachable endpoint that accepts multipart file uploads.\n\nAn attacker can send a specially crafted multipart request containing a large or unbounded stream of data that does not match known file signatures. This may cause the server to continuously allocate memory until the Node.js process exhausts available RAM and terminates due to an out-of-memory condition.\n\nThis results in a Denial of Service, making the application unavailable to legitimate users. Authentication is not required if the upload endpoint is publicly accessible.\n\n### Patches\n\nFixes targeting v6 and v7 have been published below.\n\nUsers should upgrade to a version that includes the following fix:\n- https://github.com/adonisjs/bodyparser/releases/tag/v10.1.3\n- https://github.com/adonisjs/bodyparser/releases/tag/v11.0.0-next.9",
