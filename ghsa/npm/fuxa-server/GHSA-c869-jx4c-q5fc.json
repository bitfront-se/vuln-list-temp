    "Description": "### Summary\nAn authorization bypass vulnerability in the FUXA allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to create and modify arbitrary schedulers, exposing connected ICS/SCADA environments to follow-on actions. This vulnerability affects FUXA version 1.2.8 through version 1.2.10. This has been patched in FUXA version 1.2.11.\n\n### Impact\nThis affects all deployments, including those with `runtime.settings.secureEnabled` set to `true`.\n\nExploitation allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to automatically authenticate as guest and create, modify or delete schedules. These schedules can be configured to trigger immediately or cyclically, forcing connected devices to specific states or values, or executing existing scripts on the server.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been patched in FUXA version 1.2.11. Users are strongly encouraged to update to the latest available release.",
