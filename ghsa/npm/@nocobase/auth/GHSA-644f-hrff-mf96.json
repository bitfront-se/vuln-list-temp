The manipulation of the argument API_KEY results in use of hard-coded cryptographic key\n . The attack can be launched remotely. A high complexity level is associated with this attack. The exploitability is described as difficult. The exploit is now public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way.",
