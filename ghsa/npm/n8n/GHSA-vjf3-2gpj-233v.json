    "Description": "## Impact\nAn authenticated user signed in through Single Sign-On (SSO) could disable SSO enforcement for their own account through the n8n API. This allowed the user to create a local password and authenticate directly with email and password, completely bypassing the organization's SSO policy, centralized identity management, and any identity-provider-enforced multi-factor authentication.\n\n## Patches\nThe issue has been fixed in n8n version 2.8.0. Users should upgrade to this version or later to remediate the vulnerability.\n\n## Workarounds\nIf upgrading is not immediately possible, administrators should consider the following temporary mitigations:\n- Monitor audit logs for users who create local credentials after authenticating via SSO.\n- Restrict the n8n instance to fully trusted users only.\n\nThese workarounds do not fully remediate the risk and should only be used as short-term mitigation measures.",
