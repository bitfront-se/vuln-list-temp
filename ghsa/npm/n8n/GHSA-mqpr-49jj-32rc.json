    "Description": "## Impact\nAn attacker who knows the webhook URL of a workflow using the GitHub Webhook Trigger node could send unsigned POST requests and trigger the workflow with arbitrary data. The node did not implement the HMAC-SHA256 signature verification that GitHub provides to authenticate webhook deliveries, allowing any party to spoof GitHub webhook events.\n\n## Patches\nThe issue has been fixed in n8n versions 2.5.0 and 1.123.15. Users should upgrade to one of these versions or later to remediate the vulnerability.\n\n## Workarounds\nIf upgrading is not immediately possible, administrators should consider the following temporary mitigations:\n- Limit workflow creation and editing permissions to fully trusted users only.\n- Restrict network access to the n8n webhook endpoint to known GitHub webhook IP ranges.\n\nThese workarounds do not fully remediate the risk and should only be used as short-term mitigation measures.",
