    "Description": "## Impact\nWhen the Chat Trigger node is configured with n8n User Auth authentication, the authentication check could be circumvented. \n- This issue requires the Chat Trigger node to be configured with n8n User Auth authentication (non-default).\n\n## Patches\nThe issue has been fixed in n8n versions 2.10.1, 2.9.3, and 1.123.22. Users should upgrade to one of these versions or later to remediate the vulnerability.\n\n## Workarounds\nIf upgrading is not immediately possible, administrators should consider the following temporary mitigations:\n- Limit workflow creation and editing permissions to fully trusted users only.\n- Use a different authentication method for the Chat Trigger node, or restrict network access to the webhook endpoint to trusted origins.\n\nThese workarounds do not fully remediate the risk and should only be used as short-term mitigation measures.",
