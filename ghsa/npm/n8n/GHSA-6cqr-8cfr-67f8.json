    "Description": "### Impact\n\nAdditional exploits in the expression evaluation of n8n have been identified and patched following [CVE-2025-68613](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/security/advisories/GHSA-v98v-ff95-f3cp).\n\nAn authenticated user with permission to create or modify workflows could abuse crafted expressions in workflow parameters to trigger unintended system command execution on the host running n8n.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue has been fixed in n8n versions 1.123.17 and 2.5.2. Users should upgrade to these versions or later to remediate the vulnerability.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf upgrading is not immediately possible, administrators should consider the following temporary mitigations:\n\n- Limit workflow creation and editing permissions to fully trusted users only.\n- Deploy n8n in a hardened environment with restricted operating system privileges and network access to reduce the impact of potential exploitation.\n\nThese workarounds do not fully remediate the risk and should only be used as short-term mitigation measures.\n\n### Resources\n\n- Best practices for [securing n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/securing/overview/)\n- Initial vulnerability advisory: [CVE-2025-68613](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n/security/advisories/GHSA-v98v-ff95-f3cp)\n\n---\n\nn8n has adopted CVSS 4.0 as primary score for all security advisories. CVSS 3.1 vector strings are provided for backward compatibility.\n\nCVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H",
