    "Description": "### Impact\n\nThe n8n Git node allows workflows to set arbitrary Git configuration values through the _Add Config_ operation. When an attacker-controlled workflow sets `core.hooksPath` to a directory within the cloned repository containing a Git hook such as `pre-commit`, Git executes that hook during subsequent Git operations. Because Git hooks run as local system commands, this behavior can lead to **arbitrary command execution** on the underlying n8n host.\n\nSuccessful exploitation requires the ability to create or modify an n8n workflow that uses the Git node.\n\nAffected versions: **≥ 0.123.1 and \u003c 1.119.2**\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue has been patched in **n8n version 1.119.2**.\n\nAll users running affected versions should upgrade to **1.119.2 or later**.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf upgrading is not immediately possible, the following mitigations can reduce exposure:\n\n- Exclude the Git node ([Docs](https://n8n-docs.teamlab.info/hosting/securing/blocking-nodes/#exclude-nodes)).\n- Avoid cloning or interacting with untrusted repositories using the Git Node.",
