Users should upgrade to this version or later to remediate the vulnerability.\n\n## Workarounds\nIf upgrading is not immediately possible, administrators should consider the following temporary mitigations:\n- Limit access to trusted users.\n- Review asses the practical impact of guardrail bypasses in your usecase and adjust your workflow accordingly.\n\nThese workarounds do not fully remediate the risk and should only be used as short-term mitigation measures.",
