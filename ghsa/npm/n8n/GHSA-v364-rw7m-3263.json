    "Description": "### Impact\nn8n is affected by an authenticated Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability.\n\nUnder certain conditions, an authenticated user may be able to cause untrusted code to be executed by the n8n service. This could result in full compromise of the affected instance.\n\nBoth self-hosted and n8n Cloud instances are impacted.\n\n### Patches\nThe issue has been resolved in n8n version 1.121.3.\n\nUsers are advised to upgrade to this version or later to fully address the vulnerability.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf upgrading is not immediately possible, administrators can reduce exposure by disabling the Git node and limiting access for untrusted users.\n\n### References\n- n8n documentation: [Blocking access to nodes](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/securing/blocking-nodes/)",
