    "Description": "### Impact\nEmail properties (such as to, subject, html, text, and attachments) are not reset between sends when a single client instance is reused across multiple .send() calls. This can cause properties from a previous send to leak into a subsequent one, potentially delivering content or recipient addresses to unintended parties. Applications sending emails to different recipients in sequence — such as transactional flows like password resets or notifications — are affected.\n\n### Patches\nYes, the issue has been patched. Users should upgrade to v1.5.1 or later.\n\n### Workarounds\nIf upgrading immediately is not possible, instantiate a new client for each send:\n```js\nconst client = new Lettermint({ apiKey: process.env.LETTERMINT_API_KEY });\nawait client.email.to('...').subject('...').html('...').send();\n```\n\nThis ensures no state is carried over between sends.",
