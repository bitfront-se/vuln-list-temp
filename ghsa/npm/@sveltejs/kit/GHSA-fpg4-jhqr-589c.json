    "Description": "Some relatively small inputs can cause very large files arrays in `form` handlers. If the SvelteKit application code doesn't check `files.length` or individual files' sizes and performs expensive processing with them, it can result in Denial of Service.\n\nOnly users with `experimental.remoteFunctions: true` who are using the `form` function and are processing the `files` array without validation are vulnerable.",

    "Summary": "SvelteKit  has deserialization expansion in unvalidated `form` remote function leading to Denial of Service (experimental only)",
