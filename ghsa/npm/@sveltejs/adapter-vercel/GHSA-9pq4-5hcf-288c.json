    "Description": "Versions of `@sveltejs/adapter-vercel` prior to 6.3.2 are vulnerable to cache poisoning. An internal query parameter intended for Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) is accessible on all routes, allowing an attacker to cause sensitive user-specific responses to be cached and served to other users.\n\nSuccessful exploitation requires a victim to visit an attacker-controlled link while authenticated.\n\nExisting deployments are protected by Vercel's WAF, but users should upgrade as soon as possible.",
