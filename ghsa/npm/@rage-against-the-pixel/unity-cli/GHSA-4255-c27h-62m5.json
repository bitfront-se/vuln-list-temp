    "Description": "The sign-package command in @rage-against-the-pixel/unity-cli logs sensitive credentials in plaintext when the `--verbose` flag is used. Command-line arguments including `--email` and `--password` are output via JSON.stringify without sanitization, exposing secrets to shell history, CI/CD logs, and log aggregation systems.\n\nUsers who run sign-package with `--verbose` and credential arguments expose their Unity account passwords. This affects all versions prior to 1.8.2. The vulnerability requires explicit user action (using `--verbose`) but creates significant risk in automated and shared environments.\n\nWorkaround: Use environment variables (`UNITY_USERNAME`, `UNITY_PASSWORD`) instead of command-line arguments, and avoid the `--verbose` flag when working with credentials.\n\nExisting RageAgainstThePixel and Buildalon GitHub actions are unaffected as they use the environment variables exclusively.",
