    "Description": "### Summary\n\nA timing-based user enumeration vulnerability exists in the password reset functionality. When an invalid reset_url parameter is provided, the response time differs by approximately 500ms between existing and non-existing users, enabling reliable user enumeration.\n\n### Details\n\nThe password reset endpoint implements a timing protection mechanism to prevent user enumeration; however, URL validation executes before the timing protection is applied. This allows an attacker to distinguish between valid and invalid user accounts based on response timing differences.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis vulnerability violates user privacy and may facilitate targeted phishing attacks by allowing attackers to confirm the existence of user accounts.",
