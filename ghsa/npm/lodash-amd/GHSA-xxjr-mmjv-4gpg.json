    "Description": "### Impact\n\nLodash versions 4.0.0 through 4.17.22 are vulnerable to prototype pollution in the `_.unset` and `_.omit` functions. An attacker can pass crafted paths which cause Lodash to delete methods from global prototypes. \n\nThe issue permits deletion of properties but does not allow overwriting their original behavior.  \n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue is patched on 4.17.23.",
