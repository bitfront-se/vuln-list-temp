    "Description": "## Summary\nBrowser-facing localhost mutation routes accepted cross-origin browser requests without explicit Origin/Referer validation. Loopback binding reduces remote exposure but does not prevent browser-initiated requests from malicious origins.\n\n## Impact\nA malicious website can trigger unauthorized state changes against a victim's local OpenClaw browser control plane (for example opening tabs, starting/stopping the browser, mutating storage/cookies) if the browser control service is reachable on loopback in the victim's browser context.\n\n## Affected Packages / Versions\n- openclaw (npm): \u003c= 2026.2.13\n- clawdbot (npm): \u003c= 2026.1.24-3\n\n## Details\nThe browser control servers bind to loopback but exposed mutating HTTP endpoints without a CSRF-style guard. Browsers may send cross-origin requests to loopback addresses; without explicit validation, state-changing operations could be triggered from a non-loopback Origin/Referer.\n\n## Fix\nMutating HTTP methods (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE) are rejected when the request indicates a non-loopback Origin/Referer (or `Sec-Fetch-Site: cross-site`).\n\n## Fix Commit(s)\n- openclaw/openclaw: b566b09f81e2b704bf9398d8d97d5f7a90aa94c3\n\n## Workarounds / Mitigations\n- Enable browser control auth (token/password) and avoid running with auth disabled.\n- Upgrade to a release that includes the fix.\n\n## Credits\n- Reporter: @vincentkoc\n\n## Release Process Note\n`patched_versions` is set to the planned next release version. Once that npm release is published, the advisory should be ready to publish with no further edits.",
