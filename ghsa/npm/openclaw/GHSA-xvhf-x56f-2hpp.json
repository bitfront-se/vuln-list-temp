    "Description": "## Summary\n\nOpenClaw's exec-approvals allowlist supports a small set of \"safe bins\" intended to be stdin-only (no positional file arguments) when running `tools.exec.host=gateway|node` with `security=allowlist`.\n\nIn affected configurations, the allowlist validation checked pre-expansion argv tokens, but execution used a real shell (`sh -c`) which expands globs and environment variables. This allowed safe bins like `head`, `tail`, or `grep` to read arbitrary local files via tokens such as `*` or `$HOME/...` without triggering approvals.\n\nThis issue is configuration-dependent and is not exercised by default settings (default `tools.exec.host` is `sandbox`).\n\n## Affected Packages / Versions\n\n- Package: `openclaw` (npm)\n- Affected: `\u003c= 2026.2.13`\n- Patched: `\u003e= 2026.2.14` (planned; publish the advisory after the npm release is out)\n\n## Impact\n\nAn authorized but untrusted caller (or prompt-injection) could cause the gateway/node process to disclose files readable by that process when host execution is enabled in allowlist mode.\n\n## Fix\n\nSafe-bins executions now force argv tokens to be treated as literal text at execution time (single-quoted), preventing globbing and `$VARS` expansion from turning \"safe\" tokens into file paths.\n\n## Fix Commit(s)\n\n- 77b89719d5b7e271f48b6f49e334a8b991468c3b\n\n## Release Process Note\n\n`patched_versions` is pre-set for the next planned release (`\u003e= 2026.2.14`) so publishing is a single click once that npm version is available.\n\nThanks @christos-eth for reporting.",
