    "Description": "### Summary\nThe `web_fetch` tool could be used to crash the OpenClaw Gateway process (OOM / resource exhaustion) by fetching and attempting to parse attacker-controlled web pages with oversized response bodies or pathological HTML nesting.\n\n### Affected Packages / Versions\n- Package: `openclaw` (npm)\n- Affected versions: `\u003c= 2026.2.14`\n- Fixed versions: `\u003e= 2026.2.15`\n\n### Impact\nAn attacker can social-engineer a user (or any automation that uses `web_fetch`) into fetching a malicious URL that returns extremely large or deeply nested HTML. The Gateway may exhaust memory or become unresponsive, causing a denial of service.\n\n### Fix\nThe Gateway now caps the downloaded response body size before any HTML parsing and adds additional guards to avoid running Readability/DOM parsing on pathological HTML.\n\n### Fix Commit(s)\n- 166cf6a3e04c7df42bea70a7ad5ce2b9df46d147\n\n### Release Process Note\nThis advisory is prepared for the next npm release. Once `openclaw@2026.2.15` is published, publish this advisory without further edits.\n\nThanks @xuemian168 for reporting.",
