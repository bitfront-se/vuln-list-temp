    "Description": "### Summary\n\nAn unauthenticated local client could use the Gateway WebSocket API to write config via `config.apply` and set unsafe `cliPath` values that were later used for command discovery, enabling command injection as the gateway user.\n\n### Impact\n\nA local process on the same machine could execute arbitrary commands as the gateway process user.\n\n### Details\n\n- `config.apply` accepted raw JSON and wrote it to disk after schema validation.\n- `cliPath` values were not constrained to safe executable names/paths.\n- Command discovery used a shell invocation when resolving executables.\n\n### Mitigation\n\nUpgrade to a patched release. If projects cannot upgrade immediately, set `gateway.auth` and avoid custom `cliPath` values.",
