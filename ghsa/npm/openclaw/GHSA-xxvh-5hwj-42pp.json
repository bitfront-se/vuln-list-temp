    "Description": "## Description\n\n`normalizeForHash` in `src/agents/sandbox/config-hash.ts` recursively sorted arrays that contained only primitive values. This made order-sensitive sandbox configuration arrays hash to the same value even when order changed.\n\nIn OpenClaw sandbox flows, this hash is used to decide whether existing sandbox containers should be recreated. As a result, order-only config changes (for example Docker `dns` and `binds` array order) could be treated as unchanged and stale containers could be reused.\n\nThis is a configuration integrity issue affecting sandbox recreation behavior.\n\n## Affected Packages / Versions\n\n- Package: `openclaw` (npm)\n- Affected: `\u003c=2026.2.14`\n- Patched (planned next release): `\u003e=2026.2.15`\n- Latest published npm version at triage time (2026-02-16): `2026.2.14`\n\n## Remediation\n\nArray ordering is now preserved during hash normalization; only object key ordering remains normalized for deterministic hashing.\n\n## Fix Commit(s)\n\n- `41ded303b4f6dae5afa854531ff837c3276ad60b`\n\n## Release Process Note\n\n`patched_versions` is pre-set to the planned next release (`2026.2.15`) so after npm publish, the advisory can be published directly without reopening version metadata edits.\n\nThanks @kexinoh ( of Tencent zhuque Lab, by https://github.com/Tencent/AI-Infra-Guard) for reporting.",
