    "Description": "## Overview\nOpenClaw embedded the current working directory (workspace path) into the agent system prompt without sanitization. If an attacker can cause OpenClaw to run inside a directory whose name contains control/format characters (for example newlines or Unicode bidi/zero-width markers), those characters could break the prompt structure and inject attacker-controlled instructions.\n\n## Impact\nPrompt injection may alter agent behavior and could lead to unintended tool use or disclosure of sensitive information.\n\n## Affected Packages / Versions\n- Package: `openclaw` (npm)\n- Vulnerable versions: `\u003c 2026.2.15` (latest published vulnerable version as of 2026-02-16: `2026.2.14`)\n- Patched versions: `\u003e= 2026.2.15`\n\n## Fix\nThe workspace path is now sanitized before it is embedded into any LLM prompt output, stripping Unicode control/format characters and explicit line/paragraph separators. Workspace path resolution also applies the same sanitization as defense-in-depth.\n\n## Fix Commit(s)\n- `6254e96acf16e70ceccc8f9b2abecee44d606f79`\n\nThanks @aether-ai-agent for reporting.",
