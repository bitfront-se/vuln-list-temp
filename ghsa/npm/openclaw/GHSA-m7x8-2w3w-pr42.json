    "Description": "### Summary\nCommand injection in the maintainer/dev script `scripts/update-clawtributors.ts`.\n\n### Impact\nAffects contributors/maintainers (or CI) who run `bun scripts/update-clawtributors.ts` in a source checkout that contains a malicious commit author email (e.g. crafted `@users.noreply.github.com` values).\n\nNormal CLI usage is not affected (`npm i -g openclaw`): this script is not part of the shipped CLI and is not executed during routine operation.\n\n### Affected Versions\n- Source checkouts: tags `v2026.1.8` through `v2026.2.13` (inclusive)\n- Version range (structured): `\u003e= 2026.1.8, \u003c 2026.2.14`\n\n### Details\nThe script derived a GitHub login from `git log` author metadata and interpolated it into a shell command (via `execSync`). A malicious commit record could inject shell metacharacters and execute arbitrary commands when the script is run.\n\n### Fix\n- Fix commit: `a429380e337152746031d290432a4b93aa553d55`\n- Planned patched version: `2026.2.14`\n\n### Credits\nThanks @scanleale and @MegaManSec (https://joshua.hu) of [AISLE Research Team](https://aisle.com/) for reporting.",
