    "Description": "### Summary\n\nOn Windows nodes, exec requests were executed via `cmd.exe /d /s /c \u003crawCommand\u003e`. In allowlist/approval-gated mode, the allowlist analysis did not model Windows `cmd.exe` parsing and metacharacter behavior. A crafted command string could cause `cmd.exe` to interpret additional operations (for example command chaining via `\u0026`, or expansion via `%...%` / `!...!`) beyond what was allowlisted/approved.\n\n### Affected Packages / Versions\n\n- Package: `openclaw` (npm)\n- Affected: `\u003c= 2026.2.1`\n- Patched: `\u003e= 2026.2.2`\n- Latest (npm) as of 2026-02-14: `2026.2.13`\n\n### Details\n\n- Default installs: Not affected unless you opt into exec allowlist/approval gating on Windows nodes.\n- Windows execution uses `cmd.exe` via `src/infra/node-shell.ts`.\n- The fix hardens Windows allowlist enforcement by:\n  - Passing the platform into allowlist analysis and rejecting Windows shell metacharacters.\n  - Treating `cmd.exe` invocation as not allowlist-safe on Windows.\n  - Avoiding `cmd.exe` entirely in allowlist mode by executing the parsed argv directly when possible.\n\n### Fix Commit(s)\n\n- `a7f4a53ce80c98ba1452eb90802d447fca9bf3d6`\n\nThanks @simecek for reporting.",
