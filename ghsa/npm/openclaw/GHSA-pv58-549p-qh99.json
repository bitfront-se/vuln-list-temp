    "Description": "## Summary\n\nDiscovery beacons (Bonjour/mDNS and DNS-SD) include TXT records such as `lanHost`, `tailnetDns`, `gatewayPort`, and `gatewayTlsSha256`. TXT records are unauthenticated.\n\nPrior to the fix, some clients treated TXT values as authoritative routing/pinning inputs:\n\n- iOS and macOS: used TXT-provided host hints (`lanHost`/`tailnetDns`) and ports (`gatewayPort`) to build the connection URL.\n- iOS and Android: allowed the discovery-provided TLS fingerprint (`gatewayTlsSha256`) to override a previously stored TLS pin.\n\nOn a shared/untrusted LAN, an attacker could advertise a rogue `_openclaw-gw._tcp` service. This could cause a client to connect to an attacker-controlled endpoint and/or accept an attacker certificate, potentially exfiltrating Gateway credentials (`auth.token` / `auth.password`) during connection.\n\n## Distribution / Exposure\n\nThe iOS and Android apps are currently alpha/not broadly shipped (no public App Store / Play Store release). Practical impact is primarily limited to developers/testers running those builds, plus any other shipped clients relying on discovery on a shared/untrusted LAN.\n\nCVSS can still be used for the technical (base) severity of the bug; limited distribution primarily affects environmental risk.\n\n## Affected Packages / Versions\n\n- Package: `openclaw` (npm)\n- Affected: `\u003c= 2026.2.13` (latest published on npm as of 2026-02-14)\n- Patched: planned for `\u003e= 2026.2.14` (not yet published at time of writing)\n\n## Fix\n\n- Clients now prefer the resolved service endpoint (SRV + A/AAAA) over TXT-provided routing hints.\n- Discovery-provided fingerprints no longer override stored TLS pins.\n- iOS/Android: first-time TLS pins require explicit user confirmation (fingerprint shown; no silent TOFU).\n- iOS/Android: discovery-based direct connects are TLS-only.\n- Android: hostname verification is no longer globally disabled (only bypassed when pinning).\n\n## Fix Commit(s)\n\n- d583782ee322a6faa1fe87ae52455e0d349de586\n\n## Credits\n\nThanks @simecek for reporting.",
