    "Description": "## Summary\n\n### What this means (plain language)\n\nIf you give a client “chat/write” access to the gateway (`operator.write`) but you do not intend to let that client approve exec requests (`operator.approvals`), affected versions could still let that client approve/deny a pending exec approval by sending the `/approve` chat command.\n\nThis is mainly relevant for shared or multi-client setups where different tokens are intentionally scoped differently. Single-operator installs are typically less impacted.\n\n### Technical summary\n\nA gateway client authenticated with a device token scoped only to `operator.write` (without `operator.approvals`) could approve/deny pending exec approval requests by sending a chat message containing the built-in `/approve` command.\n\n`exec.approval.resolve` is correctly scoped to `operator.approvals` for direct RPC calls, but the `/approve` command path invoked it via an internal privileged gateway client.\n\n## Affected Packages / Versions\n\n- `openclaw` (npm): `\u003c 2026.2.2`\n\n## Fix\n\n- Fixed in `openclaw` `2026.2.2`.\n- Fix commit(s): `efe2a464afcff55bb5a95b959e6bd9ec0fef086e`.\n- Change: when `/approve` is invoked from gateway clients (webchat/internal channel), it now requires the requesting client to have `operator.approvals` (or `operator.admin`).\n\n## Workarounds\n\n- Upgrade to `openclaw \u003e= 2026.2.2`.\n- If you cannot upgrade: avoid issuing write-only device tokens to untrusted clients; disable text commands (`commands.text=false`) or restrict access to the webchat/control UI.\n\n## References\n\n- Fix: `src/auto-reply/reply/commands-approve.ts`\n- Coverage: `src/auto-reply/reply/commands-approve.test.ts`\n\n## Release Process Note\n\nThis advisory is kept in draft; once the fixed npm versions are available, it can be published without further edits.\n\nThanks @yueyueL for reporting.",
