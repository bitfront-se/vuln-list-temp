    "Description": "## Summary\n\nIn affected versions, when `apply_patch` was enabled and the agent ran without filesystem sandbox containment, crafted paths could cause file writes/deletes outside the configured workspace directory.\n\n## Affected Packages / Versions\n\n- Package: `openclaw` (npm)\n- Affected: `\u003c= 2026.2.13`\n- Fixed: `\u003e= 2026.2.14`\n\n## Details\n\nThe non-sandbox path resolution in `apply_patch` did not enforce workspace containment. Inputs like `../../...` or absolute paths could escape the working directory in non-sandboxed mode.\n\n## Impact\n\nPractical impact depends on deployment and who can trigger tool execution. This is most relevant when tool invocation is exposed to less-trusted callers or when operators expected workspace-only containment.\n\n## Workarounds\n\n- Keep `tools.exec.applyPatch.enabled` disabled if you do not need `apply_patch`.\n- Keep `tools.exec.applyPatch.workspaceOnly` at its secure default of `true`.\n- Restrict who can trigger tool execution (and which tools are allowlisted).\n\n## Configuration Note\n\n`tools.exec.applyPatch.workspaceOnly: false` intentionally opts out of workspace containment and can re-enable outside-workspace writes/deletes.\n\n## Fix\n\n- PR: https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/16405\n- Merge commit: `5544646a09c0121fca7d7093812dc2de8437c7f1`\n\n## Credits\n\nThanks to @p80n-sec for reporting this issue.",
