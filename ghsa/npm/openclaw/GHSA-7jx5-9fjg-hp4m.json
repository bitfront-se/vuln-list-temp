    "Description": "## Vulnerability Summary\n\nThe OpenClaw ACP client could auto-approve tool calls based on untrusted metadata and permissive name heuristics. A malicious or compromised ACP tool invocation could bypass expected interactive approval prompts for read-class operations.\n\n## Affected Packages / Versions\n\n- Package: npm `openclaw`\n- Affected published versions: `\u003c= 2026.2.22-2` (latest published as of February 24, 2026 is `2026.2.22-2`)\n- Patched in code on `main`: `2026.2.23` (released)\n\n## Technical Details\n\n- Permission classification trusted incoming `toolCall.kind` and heuristic name matching.\n- Non-core read-like names and spoofed kind metadata could reach auto-approve paths.\n- `read` operations were not scoped strongly enough to cwd in all metadata/title forms.\n\n## Fix\n\n- Require trusted core tool IDs for auto-approval and ignore untrusted `toolCall.kind` as an authorization source.\n- Scope `read` auto-approval to cwd-resolved paths.\n- Add stricter tool-name validation and regression coverage for spoofed kind and non-core read-like names.\n\n## Affected Functions\n\n- `resolvePermissionRequest`\n- `resolveToolNameForPermission`\n- `shouldAutoApproveToolCall`\n\n## Fix Commit(s)\n\n- `12cc754332f9a7c92e158ce7644aa22df79c0904`\n- `63dcd28ae0be2de1c75af09cc81841cebeec068f`\n\nFound using [MCPwner](https://github.com/Pigyon/MCPwner)\n\n\nThanks @nedlir for reporting.",
