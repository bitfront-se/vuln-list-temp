    "Description": "## Summary\n\nOpenClaw CLI process cleanup used system-wide process enumeration and pattern matching to terminate processes without verifying they were owned by the current OpenClaw process. On shared hosts, unrelated processes could be terminated if they matched the pattern.\n\n## Affected Packages / Versions\n\n- Package: `openclaw` (npm)\n- Affected: `\u003c 2026.2.14` (including the latest published version `2026.2.13`)\n- Fixed: `2026.2.14` (planned next release)\n\n## Details\n\nThe CLI runner cleanup helpers could kill processes matched by command-line patterns without validating process ownership.\n\n## Fix\n\nProcess cleanup is now scoped to owned processes only by filtering to direct child PIDs of the current process (`ppid == process.pid`) before sending signals.\n\nHardening follow-ups:\n- Prefer graceful termination for resume cleanup (`SIGTERM`, then `SIGKILL` fallback).\n- Reduce false negatives from `ps` argv truncation by preferring wide output (`ps -axww`) with a fallback.\n- Tighten command-line token matching to avoid substring matches.\n\n## Fix Commit(s)\n\n- 6084d13b956119e3cf95daaf9a1cae1670ea3557\n- eb60e2e1b213740c3c587a7ba4dbf10da620ca66\n\n## Release Process Note\n\nThis advisory is pre-set with patched version `2026.2.14`. After `2026.2.14` is published to npm, the remaining step should be to publish this advisory.\n\nThanks @aether-ai-agent for reporting.",
