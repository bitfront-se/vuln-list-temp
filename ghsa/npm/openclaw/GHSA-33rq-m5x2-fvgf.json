    "Description": "### Summary\n\nIn the optional Twitch channel plugin (`extensions/twitch`), `allowFrom` is documented as a hard allowlist of Twitch user IDs, but it was not enforced as a hard gate. If `allowedRoles` is unset or empty, the access control path defaulted to allow, so any Twitch user who could mention the bot could reach the agent dispatch pipeline.\n\n**Scope note:** This only affects deployments that installed and enabled the Twitch plugin. Core OpenClaw installs that do not install/enable the Twitch plugin are not impacted.\n\n### Affected Packages / Versions\n\n- Package: `openclaw` (npm)\n- Affected: `\u003e= 2026.1.29, \u003c 2026.2.1`\n- Fixed: `\u003e= 2026.2.1`\n\n### Details\n\nAffected component: Twitch plugin access control (`extensions/twitch/src/access-control.ts`).\n\nProblematic logic in `checkTwitchAccessControl()`:\n\n- When `allowFrom` was configured, the code returned `allowed: true` for members but did not return `allowed: false` for non-members, so execution fell through.\n- If `allowedRoles` was unset or empty, the function returned `allowed: true` by default, even when `allowFrom` was configured.\n\n### Proof of Concept (PoC)\n\n1. Install and enable the Twitch plugin.\n2. Configure an `allowFrom` list, but do not set `allowedRoles` (or set it to an empty list).\n3. From a different Twitch account whose user ID is NOT in `allowFrom`, send a message that mentions the bot (for example `@\u003cbotname\u003e hello`).\n4. Observe the message is processed and can trigger agent dispatch/replies despite not being allowlisted.\n\n### Impact\n\nAuthorization bypass for operators who relied on `allowFrom` to restrict who can invoke the bot in Twitch chat. Depending on configuration (tools, routing, model costs), this could lead to unintended actions/responses and resource or cost exhaustion.\n\n### Fix Commit(s)\n\n- `8c7901c984866a776eb59662dc9d8b028de4f0d0`\n\n### Workaround\n\nUpgrade to `openclaw \u003e= 2026.2.1`.\n\nThanks @MegaManSec (https://joshua.hu) of [AISLE Research Team](https://aisle.com/) for reporting.",
