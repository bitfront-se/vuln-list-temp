    "Description": "### Summary\n\nOpenClaw's SSRF protection could be bypassed using full-form IPv4-mapped IPv6 literals such as `0:0:0:0:0:ffff:7f00:1` (which is `127.0.0.1`). This could allow requests that should be blocked (loopback / private network / link-local metadata) to pass the SSRF guard.\n\n- Vulnerable component: SSRF guard (`src/infra/net/ssrf.ts`)\n- Issue type: SSRF protection bypass\n\n### Affected Packages / Versions\n\n- Package: `openclaw` (npm)\n- Vulnerable: `\u003c= 2026.2.13`\n- Patched: `\u003e= 2026.2.14` (planned next release)\n\n### Details\n\nThe SSRF guard's IP classification did not consistently detect private IPv4 addresses when they were embedded in IPv6 using full-form IPv4-mapped IPv6 notation. As a result, inputs like `0:0:0:0:0:ffff:7f00:1` could bypass loopback/private network blocking.\n\n### Fix Commit(s)\n\n- `c0c0e0f9aecb913e738742f73e091f2f72d39a19`\n\n### Release Process Note\n\nThis advisory is kept in draft state with the patched version set to the planned next release. Once `openclaw@2026.2.14` is published to npm, the only remaining step should be to publish this advisory.\n\nThanks @yueyueL for reporting.",
