    "Description": "An information disclosure vulnerability in OpenClaw's `tools.exec.safeBins` approval flow allowed a file-existence oracle.\n\nWhen safe-bin validation examined candidate file paths, command allow/deny behavior could differ based on whether a path already existed on the host filesystem. An attacker could probe for file presence by comparing outcomes for existing vs non-existing filenames.\n\n## Affected Packages / Versions\n- Package: `openclaw` (npm)\n- Affected versions: `\u003c= 2026.2.17`\n- Latest published vulnerable version at triage time: `2026.2.17`\n- Planned patched version: `2026.2.18`\n\n## Impact\nAttackers with access to this execution surface could infer whether specific files exist (for example secrets/config files), enabling filesystem enumeration and improving follow-on attack planning.\n\n## Fix\nThe safe-bin policy was changed to deterministic argv-only validation without host file-existence checks. File-oriented flags are blocked for safe-bin mode (for example `sort -o`, `jq -f`, `grep -f`), and trusted-path checks remain enforced.\n\n## Fix Commit(s)\n- `bafdbb6f112409a65decd3d4e7350fbd637c7754`\n\nFound using [MCPwner](https://github.com/Pigyon/MCPwner)\n\nThanks @nedlir for reporting.",
