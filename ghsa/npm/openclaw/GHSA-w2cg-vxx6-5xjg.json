    "Description": "## Summary\n\nBase64-backed media inputs could be decoded into Buffers before enforcing decoded-size budgets. An attacker supplying oversized base64 payloads can force large allocations, causing memory pressure and denial of service.\n\n## Attack Scenario Notes\n\n- Recommended deployments bind the gateway to loopback by default and require gateway auth for HTTP endpoints. In that configuration, this is best modeled as a local/authorized DoS.\n- If an operator exposes the gateway to untrusted networks (or disables/weakens auth and rate limits), treat this as a higher-severity network DoS risk.\n\n## Affected Packages / Versions\n\n- openclaw (npm): \u003c= 2026.2.13\n- clawdbot (npm): \u003c= 2026.1.24-3\n\n## Fixed In\n\n- openclaw (npm): 2026.2.14 (planned)\n- clawdbot (npm): no patched release planned; migrate to openclaw\n\n## Fix Commit(s)\n\n- 31791233d60495725fa012745dde8d6ee69e9595\n\n## Credits\nThanks @vincentkoc for reporting.",
