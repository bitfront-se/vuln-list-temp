    "Description": "## Summary\n\nA mismatch between `rawCommand` and `command[]` in the node host `system.run` handler could cause allowlist/approval evaluation to be performed on one command while executing a different argv.\n\n## Affected Configurations\n\nThis only impacts deployments that:\n\n- Use the node host / companion node execution path (`system.run` on a node).\n- Enable allowlist-based exec policy (`security=allowlist`) with approval prompting driven by allowlist misses (for example `ask=on-miss`).\n- Allow an attacker to invoke `system.run`.\n\nDefault/non-node configurations are not affected.\n\n## Impact\n\nIn affected configurations, an attacker who can invoke `system.run` can bypass allowlist enforcement and approval prompts by supplying an allowlisted `rawCommand` while providing a different `command[]` argv for execution.\n\n## Affected Packages / Versions\n\n- Package: `openclaw` (npm)\n- Affected versions: `\u003c= 2026.2.13`\n- Patched version: `\u003e= 2026.2.14` (planned next release)\n\n## Fix\n\nEnforce `rawCommand`/`command[]` consistency (gateway fail-fast + node host validation).\n\n## Fix Commit(s)\n\n- cb3290fca32593956638f161d9776266b90ab891\n\n## Release Process Note\n\nThis advisory pre-sets the patched version to the planned next release (`2026.2.14`). Once `openclaw@2026.2.14` is published to npm, the advisory can be published without further edits.\n\nThanks @christos-eth for reporting.",
