    "Description": "### Summary\n\nThe sigstore-python OAuth authentication flow is susceptible to Cross-Site Request Forgery.\n\n### Details\n\n`_OAuthSession` creates a unique \"state\" and sends it as a parameter in the authentication request but the \"state\" in the server response seems not not be cross-checked with this value. \n\nFix should be fairly trivial.\n\n### Impact\n\nThis should be low impact: A man-in-the middle attacker could trick a sigstore-python user into signing something with an identity controlled by the attacker (by returning the response to an authentication request they created). This would be quite confusing but not dangerous.",
