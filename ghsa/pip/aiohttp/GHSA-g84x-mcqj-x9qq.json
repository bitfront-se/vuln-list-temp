    "Description": "### Summary\n\nHandling of chunked messages can result in excessive blocking CPU usage when receiving a large number of chunks.\n\n### Impact\n\nIf an application makes use of the `request.read()` method in an endpoint, it may be possible for an attacker to cause the server to spend a moderate amount of blocking CPU time (e.g. 1 second) while processing the request. This could potentially lead to DoS as the server would be unable to handle other requests during that time.\n\n-----\n\nPatch: https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/commit/dc3170b56904bdf814228fae70a5501a42a6c712\nPatch: https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp/commit/4ed97a4e46eaf61bd0f05063245f613469700229",
