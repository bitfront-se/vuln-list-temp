    "Description": "### Summary\n\nPicklescan uses the `numpy.f2py.crackfortran._eval_length` function (a NumPy F2PY helper) to execute arbitrary Python code during unpickling.\n\n### Details\n\nPicklescan fails to detect a malicious pickle that uses the gadget `numpy.f2py.crackfortran._eval_length` in `__reduce__`, allowing arbitrary command execution when the pickle is loaded. A crafted object returns this function plus attacker‑controlled arguments; the scan reports the file as safe, but pickle.load() triggers execution.\n\n### PoC\n```python\nclass PoC:\n    def __reduce__(self):\n        from numpy.f2py.crackfortran import _eval_length\n        return _eval_length, (\"__import__('os').system('whoami')\", None)\n```\n\n### Impact\n\n- Arbitrary code execution on the victim machine once they load the “scanned as safe” pickle / model file.\n- Affects any workflow relying on Picklescan to vet untrusted pickle / PyTorch artifacts.\n- Enables supply‑chain poisoning of shared model files.\n\n### Credits\n- [ac0d3r](https://github.com/ac0d3r)\n- [Tong Liu](https://lyutoon.github.io), Institute of information engineering, CAS",
