    "Description": "An issue was discovered in 6.0 before 6.0.2, 5.2 before 5.2.11, and 4.2 before 4.2.28.\n\n`.QuerySet.order_by()` is subject to SQL injection in column aliases containing periods when the same alias is, using a suitably crafted dictionary, with dictionary expansion, used in `FilteredRelation`. Earlier, unsupported Django series (such as 5.0.x, 4.1.x, and 3.2.x) were not evaluated and may also be affected.\n\nDjango would like to thank Solomon Kebede for reporting this issue.",
