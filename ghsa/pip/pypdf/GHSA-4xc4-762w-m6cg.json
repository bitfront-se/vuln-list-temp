    "Description": "### Impact\nAn attacker who exploits this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads to possibly long runtimes for actually invalid files. This can be achieved by omitting the `/Root` entry in the trailer, while using a rather large `/Size` value. Only the non-strict reading mode is affected.\n\n### Patches\nThis has been fixed in [pypdf==6.6.0](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/releases/tag/6.6.0).\n\n### Workarounds\n\n```python\nfrom pypdf import PdfReader, PdfWriter\n\n\n# Instead of\nreader = PdfReader(\"file.pdf\")\n# use the strict mode:\nreader = PdfReader(\"file.pdf\", strict=True)\n\n# Instead of\nwriter = PdfWriter(clone_from=\"file.pdf\")\n# use an explicit strict reader:\nwriter = PdfWriter(clone_from=PdfReader(\"file.pdf\", strict=True))\n```\n\n### Resources\nThis issue has been fixed in #3594.",
