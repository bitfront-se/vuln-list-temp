    "Description": "### Impact\nAn attacker who uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads to the RAM being exhausted. This requires accessing the `xfa` property of a reader or writer and the corresponding stream being compressed using `/FlateDecode`.\n\n### Patches\nThis has been fixed in [pypdf==6.7.3](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/releases/tag/6.7.3).\n\n### Workarounds\nIf projects cannot upgrade yet, consider applying the changes from PR [#3658](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/pull/3658).",
