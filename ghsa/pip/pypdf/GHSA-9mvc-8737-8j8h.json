    "Description": "### Impact\n\nAn attacker who uses this vulnerability can craft a PDF which leads to long runtimes. This requires a malformed `/FlateDecode` stream, where the byte-by-byte decompression is used.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis has been fixed in [pypdf==6.7.1](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/releases/tag/6.7.1).\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf you cannot upgrade yet, consider applying the changes from PR [#3644](https://github.com/py-pdf/pypdf/pull/3644).",
