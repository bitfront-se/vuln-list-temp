    "Description": "In mlflow version 2.20.3, the temporary directory used for creating Python virtual environments is assigned insecure world-writable permissions (0o777). This vulnerability allows an attacker with write access to the `/tmp` directory to exploit a race condition and overwrite `.py` files in the virtual environment, leading to arbitrary code execution. The issue is resolved in version 3.4.0.",
