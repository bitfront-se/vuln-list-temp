    "Description": "**Summary**\nAWS CLI is a command line tool for interacting with AWS services. When the cli_history feature is enabled, the history database file is created with default permissions, potentially allowing other local users on a multi-user system to read the file.\n\n**Impact**\nWhen cli_history is enabled, AWS CLI stores command history including command parameters and API request/response data in a local SQLite database. On multi-user Unix systems, the default file permissions may allow other local users to read this file, potentially exposing sensitive information. This issue only affects users who have explicitly enabled cli_history, which is disabled by default.\n\n**Impacted versions:** 1.13.0 - 1.44.37 (v1), 2.0.0 - 2.33.20 (v2)\n\n**Patches**\nThis issue has been addressed in the latest versions 2.33.21 and 1.44.38 of AWS CLI. We recommend upgrading to the latest version and ensuring any forked or derivative code is patched to incorporate the new fixes. \n\n**Workarounds**\nUsers can manually set restrictive permissions on the history database file. Alternatively, disable cli_history by removing `cli_history = enabled` from the AWS config file.\n\n**Resources**\nIf there are any questions or comments about this advisory, contact AWS Security via the [vulnerability reporting page](https://aws.amazon.com/security/vulnerability-reporting) or directly via email to [aws-security@amazon.com](mailto:aws-security@amazon.com). Please do not create a public GitHub issue.",
