    "Description": "## Impact\n\nurllib3 supports chained HTTP encoding algorithms for response content according to RFC 9110 (e.g., `Content-Encoding: gzip, zstd`).\n\nHowever, the number of links in the decompression chain was unbounded allowing a malicious server to insert a virtually unlimited number of compression steps leading to high CPU usage and massive memory allocation for the decompressed data.\n\n\n## Affected usages\n\nApplications and libraries using urllib3 version 2.5.0 and earlier for HTTP requests to untrusted sources unless they disable content decoding explicitly.\n\n\n## Remediation\n\nUpgrade to at least urllib3 v2.6.0 in which the library limits the number of links to 5.\n\nIf upgrading is not immediately possible, use [`preload_content=False`](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/2.5.0/advanced-usage.html#streaming-and-i-o) and ensure that `resp.headers[\"content-encoding\"]` contains a safe number of encodings before reading the response content.",
