    "Description": "`(*Point).MultiScalarMult` failed to initialize its receiver.\n\nIf the method was called on an initialized point that is not the identity point, MultiScalarMult produced an incorrect result.\n\nIf the method was called on an uninitialized point, the behavior was undefined. In particular, if the receiver was the zero value, MultiScalarMult returned an invalid point that compared Equal to every point.\n\n*Note that MultiScalarMult is a rarely used advanced API. For example, if you only depend on `filippo.io/edwards25519` via `github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql`, **you are not affected**. If you were notified of this issue despite not being affected, consider switching to a vulnerability scanner that is more precise and respectful of your attention, like [govulncheck](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/govulncheck).*",
