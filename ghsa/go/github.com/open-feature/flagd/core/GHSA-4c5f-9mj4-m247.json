    "Description": "### Summary\nIn 2025, several vulnerabilities in the Go Standard Library were disclosed, impacting Go-based applications like flagd (the evaluation engine for OpenFeature). These CVEs primarily focus on Denial of Service (DoS) through resource exhaustion and Race Conditions in database handling. \n\n| CVE ID | Impacted Package | Severity | Description \u0026 Impact on flagd |\n| -- | -- | -- | -- |\n| CVE-2025-47907 | database/sql | 7.0 (High) | Race Condition:  Canceling a query during a Scan call can return data from the wrong query. Critical if flagd uses SQL-based sync providers (e.g., Postgres), potentially leading to incorrect flag configurations. |\n| CVE-2025-61725 | net/mail | 7.5 (High) | DoS: Inefficient complexity in ParseAddress.  Attackers can provide crafted email strings with large domain literals to exhaust CPU if flagd parses email-formatted metadata. |\n| CVE-2025-61723 | encoding/pem | 7.5 (High) | DoS: Quadratic complexity when parsing invalid PEM inputs. Relevant if flagd loads TLS certificates or keys via PEM files from untrusted sources. |\n| CVE-2025-61729 | crypto/x509 | 7.5 (High) | Resource Exhaustion: HostnameError.Error() lacks string concatenation limits. A malicious TLS certificate with thousands of hostnames could crash flagd during connection handshakes. |\n| CVE-2025-58188 | net/http | Medium | Request Smuggling: Improper header handling in HTTP/1.1. Could allow attackers to bypass security filters positioned in front of flagd sync or evaluation APIs. |\n| CVE-2025-58187 | archive/zip | Medium | DoS:  Improper validation of malformed ZIP archives.  Impacts flagd if configured to fetch and unpack zipped configuration bundles from remote providers. |",
