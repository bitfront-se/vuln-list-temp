    "Description": "## Summary\n\nA security fix is now available for Step CA that resolves a vulnerability affecting deployments configured with the SSHPOP provisioner.\nAll operators running these provisioners should upgrade to the latest release (`v0.29.0`) immediately.\n\nThe issue was discovered and responsibly disclosed by a research team during a security review. There is no evidence of active exploitation.\n\nTo limit exploitation risk during a coordinated disclosure window, we are withholding detailed technical information for now. A full write-up will be published in several weeks.\n\n---\n\n## Embargo List\n\nIf your organization runs Step CA in production and would like advance, embargoed notification of future security updates, visit https://u.step.sm/disclosure to request inclusion on our embargo list.\n\n---\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nThis issue was identified and reported by Gabriel Departout and Andy Russon, from [AMOSSYS](http://amossys.fr/). This audit was sponsored by [ANSSI](https://cyber.gouv.fr/) (French Cybersecurity Agency) based on [their Open-Source security audit program](https://cyber.gouv.fr/open-source-lanssi#:~:text=Financement%20d%27%C3%A9valuations%20de%20s%C3%A9curit%C3%A9%20de%20logiciels%20libres).\n\n---\n\nStay safe, and thank you for helping us keep the ecosystem secure.",
