    "Description": "# Security Disclosure: Improper validation of configured threshold for delegations\n\n## Summary\n\nA compromised or misconfigured TUF repository can have the configured value of signature thresholds set to 0, which effectively disables signature verification. \n\n## Impact\n\nUnathorized modification to TUF metadata files is possible at rest, or during transit as no integrity checks are made.\n\n## Patches\n\nUpgrade to v2.3.1\n\n## Workarounds\n\nAlways make sure that the TUF metadata roles are configured with a threshold of at least 1.\n\n## Affected code:\n\nThe `metadata.VerifyDelegate` did not verify the configured threshold prior to comparison. This means that a misconfigured TUF repository could disable the signature verification by setting the threshold to 0, or a negative value (and so always make the signature threshold computation to pass).",
