    "Description": "## Vulnerability Name\nFile Read API Case Sensitivity Bypass Vulnerability\n\n## Overview\nThe `/api/file/getFile` endpoint uses case-sensitive string equality checks to intercept access to sensitive files. On Windows (case-insensitive file systems), attackers can bypass these protections using mixed-case paths to read protected configuration files.\n\n## Impact\n- Read sensitive information from configuration files (such as access codes, API tokens, synchronization configurations, etc.)\n- Remote direct exploitation possible when the publishing service runs without authentication\n\n## Trigger Conditions\n- Running on a case-insensitive file system\n- Caller has access to `/api/file/getFile` (either through CheckAuth or by injecting tokens via the publishing service)\n\n## Proof of Concept\nAfter enabling publishing:\n\n### Request\n\n``` \nPOST /api/file/getFile \nContent-Type: application/json\n\n{\"path\":\"cOnf/conf.json\"}\n```\n\n\n### Expected Result\n- Successfully returns the contents of the configuration file\n\n## Root Cause\nThe path comparison uses strict case-sensitive string matching without case normalization or file-level comparison.\n\n## Fix Recommendations\n- Normalize paths to lowercase/canonical form before comparison (Windows/macOS)\n- Use file-level comparison methods such as `os.SameFile`\n- Apply case-normalized blacklist checks for all sensitive paths\n\n## Notes\n- Environment-specific identifiers and sensitive information have been removed\n\n## Resolution\nCommit: `399a38893e8719968ea2512e177bb53e09973fa6`\n\n---\n\n## Summary\nThis is a path traversal/bypass vulnerability where case sensitivity differences between file systems can be exploited to access protected configuration files through the file read API.\n\n# Vulnerability Report Translation\nThis advisory was translated from Chinese (Simplified Chinese) by GitHub Copilot.",
