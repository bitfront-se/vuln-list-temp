    "Description": "### Summary\n\nA vulnerability exists in Babylon’s BLS vote extension processing where a malicious active validator can submit a VoteExtension with the `block_hash` field omitted from the protobuf serialization. Because protobuf fields are optional, unmarshalling succeeds but leaves `BlockHash` as nil. Babylon then dereferences this nil pointer in consensus-critical code paths (notably `VerifyVoteExtension`, and also proposal-time vote verification), causing a runtime panic.\n\n### Impact\n\nIntermittent validator crashes at epoch boundaries, which would slow down the creation of the epoch boundary block.\n\n### Finder \n\nVulnerability discovered by:\n\n- @GrumpyLaurie55348",
