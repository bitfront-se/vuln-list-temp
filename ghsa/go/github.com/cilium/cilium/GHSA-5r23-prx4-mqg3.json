    "Description": "### Impact\n\n[Host Policies](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/language/#host-policies) will incorrectly permit traffic from Pods on other nodes when all of the following configurations are enabled:\n* [Native Routing](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/network/concepts/routing/#native-routing)\n* [WireGuard](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/policy/language/#host-policies)\n* [Node Encryption](https://docs.cilium.io/en/stable/security/network/encryption-wireguard/#node-to-node-encryption-beta) (beta)\n\nThese options are disabled by default in Cilium.\n\n### Patches\n\nThis issue was fixed by #42892.\n\nThis issue affects:\n\n* Cilium v1.18 between v1.18.0 and v1.18.5 inclusive\n\nThis issue is fixed in:\n\n* Cilium v1.18.6\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere is currently no officially verified or comprehensive workaround for this issue. The following procedure has been validated strictly within a local 'Kind' environment and has not undergone exhaustive testing across diverse production architectures. Proceed with caution.\n\nTo mitigate the identified traffic bypass, ensure all ingress traffic from the `cilium_wg0` interface is explicitly routed to `cilium_host` for policy enforcement. This ensures that host-level security policies are applied to decrypted WireGuard traffic. Execute the following configuration on each CiliumNode:\n\n```bash\n# IPv4 Traffic\nip rule add iif cilium_wg0 table 300\nip route add default dev cilium_host table 300\n\n# IPv6 Traffic\nip -6 rule add iif cilium_wg0 table 300\nip -6 route add default dev cilium_net table 300\n```\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nSpecial thanks to @julianwiedmann for reporting the issue and helping with the resolution.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you think you have found a vulnerability affecting Cilium, we strongly encourage you to report it to our security mailing list at security@cilium.io. This is a private mailing list for the Cilium security team, and your report will be treated as top priority. Please also address any comments or questions on this advisory to the same mailing list.",
