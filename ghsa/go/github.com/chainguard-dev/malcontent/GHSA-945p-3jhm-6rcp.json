    "Description": "Previously, malcontent would remove nested archives which failed to extract which could potentially leave malicious content. A better approach is to preserve these archives so that malcontent can attempt a best-effort scan of the archive bytes.\n\n**Fix**:  https://github.com/chainguard-dev/malcontent/pull/1383\n\n**Acknowledgements**\n\nmalcontent thanks Oleh Konko from [1seal](https://1seal.org/) for discovering and reporting this issue.",
