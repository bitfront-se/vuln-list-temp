    "Description": "### Impact\nWhen ran in sse or streaming mode (--transport), the Docker MCP Gateway is vulnerable to a DNS rebinding attack. \n\nVulnerability allows for Browser-Based exploitation of any MCP servers that are executing within the Docker MCP Gateway. Any tools or other features exposed by MCP servers can be manipulated by an attacker who is able to get a victim to visit a malicious website, or if a victim is served a malicious advertisement. \n\nThe MCP Gateway is not prone to this attack when started in its default stdio mode, which does not listen on any network ports.\n\n\n### Patches\nPatch available in version v0.28.0\n\n### Workarounds\nDo not start the MCP gateway in sse or streaming mode (use default stdio)",
