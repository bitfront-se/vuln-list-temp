    "Description": "The Go MCP SDK used Go's standard encoding/json.Unmarshal for JSON-RPC and MCP protocol message parsing. Go's standard library performs case-insensitive matching of JSON keys to struct field tags — a field tagged json:\"method\" would also match \"Method\", \"METHOD\", etc. Additionally, Go's standard library folds the Unicode characters ſ (U+017F) and K (U+212A) to their ASCII equivalents s and k, meaning fields like \"paramſ\" would match \"params\". This violated the JSON-RPC 2.0 specification, which defines exact field names.\n\n#### Impact:\n\nA malicious MCP peer may have been able to send protocol messages with non-standard field casing (e.g., \"Method\" instead of \"method\") that the SDK would silently accept. This had the potential for:\n  - **Bypassing intermediary inspection:** Proxies or policy layers that matched on exact field names may have failed to detect or filter these messages.\n  - **Cross-implementation inconsistency:** Other MCP SDKs (TypeScript, Python) use case-sensitive parsing and would reject the same messages, creating potential security-boundary confusion.\n\n####  Fix:\n\nGo's standard JSON unmarshaling was replaced with a case-sensitive decoder (github.com/segmentio/encoding) in commit 7b8d81c. Users are advised to update to v1.3.1 to resolve this issue.\n\n#### Credits:\nMCP Go SDK thanks Francesco Lacerenza (Doyensec) for reporting this issue.",
