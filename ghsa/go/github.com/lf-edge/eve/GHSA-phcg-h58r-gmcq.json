    "Description": "### Impact\nPCR14 is not included in the list of PCRs that seal/unseal the vault key. Additionally, the vault key uses SHA1 PCRs instead of SHA256.\nThus an attacker with physical access can take out the disk, use a different computer to modify the files in the /config partition, and re-insert the disk and boot without the change being detected by measured boot and remote attestation.\n\n### Patches\n\nFixed in EVE version 9.4.3-lts\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNone (apart from preventing physical access to the device)\n\n### Resources\n\nhttps://help.zededa.com/hc/en-us/articles/43295940828827-TPM-PCR-Index-Security-Implications\nhttps://github.com/lf-edge/eve/commit/d9383a7ee4e1c39f5c8c6d4a63cb2ebd00695e8a",
