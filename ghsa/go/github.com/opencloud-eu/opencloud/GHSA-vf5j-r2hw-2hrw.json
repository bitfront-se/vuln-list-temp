    "Description": "### Impact\n\nA security issue was discovered in [Reva](https://github.com/opencloud-eu/reva) that enables a malicious user to bypass the scope validation of a public link. That allows it to access resources outside the scope of a public link.\n\nOpenCloud uses Reva as one of its core components and thus it is affected.\n\n### Patches\n\nUpdate to OpenCloud version \u003e= 4.0.3 (stable release)\nUpdate to OpenCloud version \u003e= 5.0.2 (rolling release)\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf projects are unable to update immediately, please implement the following security configuration to disable public link shares temporarily until the final solution for this problem is rolled out.\n\n#### Configuration Adjustment\n\n* Docker Compose: Edit the docker-compose.yml and add `GATEWAY_STORAGE_PUBLIC_LINK_ENDPOINT=“”` (empty string value) in the `environment` section of the `opencloud` container.\n\n\n#### Verification of Mitigation\n\nExecute the following test: \n- Create a public link for testing. \n- Open the link url in a private (no active login) browser tab. \n- An error page with “unknown error” will be displayed.\n\nThis configuration provides immediate protection and should be implemented immediately. Configuration mitigation is available. It mitigates the problem completely.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf there are questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n- Security Support: [security@opencloud.eu](mailto:security@opencloud.eu)\n- Technical Support: [support@opencloud.eu](mailto:support@opencloud.eu)",
