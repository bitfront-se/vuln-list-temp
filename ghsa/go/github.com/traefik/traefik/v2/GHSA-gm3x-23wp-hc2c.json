    "Description": "## Impact\n\nThere is a potential vulnerability in Traefik managing the requests using a `PathPrefix`, `Path` or `PathRegex` matcher.\n\nWhen Traefik is configured to route the requests to a backend using a matcher based on the path; if the request path contains an encoded restricted character from the following set **('/', '\\', 'Null', ';', '?', '#')**, it’s possible to target a backend, exposed using another router, by-passing the middlewares chain.\n\n## Example\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: traefik.io/v1alpha1\nkind: IngressRoute\nmetadata:\n  name: my-service\nspec:\n  routes:\n    - match: PathPrefix(‘/admin/’)\n      kind: Rule\n      services:\n        - name: service-a\n          port: 8080\n      middlewares:\n        - name: my-security-middleware\n    - match: PathPrefix(‘/’)\n      kind: Rule\n      services:\n        - name: service-a\n          port: 8080\n```\n\nIn such a case, the request `http://mydomain.example.com/admin%2F` will reach the backend `service-a` without operating the middleware `my-security-middleware` and passing the security put in place for the `/admin/` path.\n\n## Patches\n\n- https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/tag/v2.11.32\n- https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/tag/v3.6.4\n\n## For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please [open an issue](https://github.com/traefik/traefik/issues).\n\n\u003cdetails\u003e\n\u003csummary\u003eOriginal Description\u003c/summary\u003e### Summary\nA vulnerability exists in Traefik’s path matching logic that allows attackers to bypass access-control middleware (e.g., blocking rules) by using URL-encoded paths. I found this vulnerability while playing PwnSec CTF 2025 with my team @0xL4ugh\n\n### Details\nTraefik evaluates router rules before decoding or normalizing the request path, but forwards the request after decoding to the backend service. As a result, routes meant to block access to sensitive endpoints (such as internal, beta, or admin endpoints) can be trivially bypassed.\n\n### PoC\nTraefik configuration used in this issue :\n```[http.routers.flask-router-report-deny]\n  entryPoints = [\"web\"]\n  rule = \"PathPrefix(`/report_note`)\"\n  priority = 10\n  middlewares = [\"block-access\"]\n  service = \"flask-service\"\n\n[http.middlewares.block-access.replacePathRegex]\n  regex = \".*\"\n  replacement = \"/blocked\"\n```\nThe intention is to block all access to /report_note.\n\nHowever, the following request bypasses the block:\n```\nPOST /%2freport_note HTTP/1.1\nHost: localhost:62814\n\n\n```\n### Impact\nAccess Control Bypass:\nAny endpoint intended to be blocked (e.g., admin/debug/beta APIs) can be accessed by URL-encoding slashes or other characters.\n\nThis could lead to:\n\n- Unauthorized access to restricted endpoints\n- Execution of protected internal functionality\n- Potential privilege escalation\n- Bypass of security policies enforced via Traefik routing rules\n\u003c/details\u003e",
