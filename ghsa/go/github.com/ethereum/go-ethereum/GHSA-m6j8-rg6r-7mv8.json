    "Description": "### Impact\n\nThrough a flaw in the ECIES cryptography implementation, an attacker may be able to extract bits of the p2p node key.\n\n### Patches\n\nThe issue is resolved in the v1.16.9 and v1.17.0 releases of Geth. We recommend rotating the node key after applying the upgrade, which can be done by removing the file `\u003cdatadir\u003e/geth/nodekey` before starting Geth.\n\n### Credit\n\nThe issue was reported as a public pull request to go-ethereum by @fengjian.",
