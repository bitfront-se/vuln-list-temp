    "Description": "A Path Traversal vulnerability was discovered in apko's dirFS filesystem abstraction. An attacker who can supply a malicious APK package (e.g., via a compromised or typosquatted repository) could create directories or symlinks outside the intended installation root. The MkdirAll, Mkdir, and Symlink methods in pkg/apk/fs/rwosfs.go use filepath.Join() without validating that the resulting path stays within the base directory.\n\n**Fix:** Fixed by [d8b7887](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/apko/commit/d8b7887a968a527791b3c591ae83928cb49a9f14). Merged into release. \n\n**Acknowledgements**                                                                                                                                                                        \n                                                                                                                                                                                              \napko thanks Oleh Konko from [1seal](https://1seal.org/) for discovering and reporting this issue.",
