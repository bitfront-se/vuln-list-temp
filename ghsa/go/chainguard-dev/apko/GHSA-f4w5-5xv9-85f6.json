    "Description": "An attacker who controls or compromises an APK repository used by apko could cause resource exhaustion on the build host. The ExpandApk function in pkg/apk/expandapk/expandapk.go expands .apk streams without enforcing decompression limits, allowing a malicious repository to serve a small, highly-compressed .apk that inflates into a large tar stream, consuming excessive disk space and CPU time, causing build failures or denial of service.                                                                                                                       \n                                                                                                                                                                                             \n**Fix**: Fixed in [2be3903](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/apko/commit/2be3903fe194ad46351840f0569b35f5ac965f09).
