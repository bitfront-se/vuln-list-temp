An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malicious Cisco\u0026nbsp;Discovery Protocol or LLDP packet to the targeted IP phone. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute code on the affected IP phone or cause it to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.Note: Cisco\u0026nbsp;Discovery Protocol is a Layer 2 protocol. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the affected device (Layer 2 adjacent).Cisco\u0026nbsp;has released software updates that address these vulnerabilities. There are no workarounds that address these vulnerabilities."
