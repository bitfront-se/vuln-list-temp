          "value": "A vulnerability in the ipsecmgr process of Cisco\u0026nbsp;ASR 5000 Series Software (StarOS) could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of incoming Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) packets. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specifically malformed IKEv2 packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the ipsecmgr process to restart, which would disrupt ongoing IKE negotiations and result in a temporary DoS condition.Cisco\u0026nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."
