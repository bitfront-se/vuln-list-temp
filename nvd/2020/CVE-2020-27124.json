An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by establishing an SSL/TLS connection with the affected device and then sending a malicious SSL/TLS message within that connection. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the device to reload.Cisco\u0026nbsp;has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."
