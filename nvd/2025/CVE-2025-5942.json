If this gap is successfully exploited, an unprivileged user can trigger a heap overflow in the epdlpdrv.sys driver, leading to a Blue-Screen-of-Death (BSOD). Successful exploitation can also potentially be performed by an unprivileged user whose NS Client is configured to use Endpoint DLP. A successful exploit can result in a denial-of-service for the local machine."
