Although in the case that an IOMMU is present\nwhose driver has failed to probe, users cannot necessarily expect DMA to\nwork anyway, it's still arguable that we should do our best to put\nthings back as if the IOMMU driver was never there at all, and certainly\nthe potential for crashing in iommu-dma itself is undesirable. Make sure\nwe clean up the dev-\u003edma_iommu flag along with everything else."
