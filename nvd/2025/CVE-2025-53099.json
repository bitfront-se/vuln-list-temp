          "value": "Sentry is a developer-first error tracking and performance monitoring tool. Prior to version 25.5.0, an attacker with a malicious OAuth application registered with Sentry can take advantage of a race condition and improper handling of authorization code within Sentry to maintain persistence to a user's account. With a specially timed requests and redirect flows, an attacker could generate multiple authorization codes that could be used to exchange for access and refresh tokens. This was possible even after de-authorizing the particular application. This issue has been patched in version 25.5.0. Self-hosted Sentry users should upgrade to version 25.5.0 or higher. Sentry SaaS users do not need to take any action."
