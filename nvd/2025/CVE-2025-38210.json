          "value": "In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:\n\nconfigfs-tsm-report: Fix NULL dereference of tsm_ops\n\nUnlike sysfs, the lifetime of configfs objects is controlled by\nuserspace. There is no mechanism for the kernel to find and delete all\ncreated config-items. Instead, the configfs-tsm-report mechanism has an\nexpectation that tsm_unregister() can happen at any time and cause\nestablished config-item access to start failing.\n\nThat expectation is not fully satisfied. While tsm_report_read(),\ntsm_report_{is,is_bin}_visible(), and tsm_report_make_item() safely fail\nif tsm_ops have been unregistered, tsm_report_privlevel_store()\ntsm_report_provider_show() fail to check for ops registration. Add the\nmissing checks for tsm_ops having been removed.\n\nNow, in supporting the ability for tsm_unregister() to always succeed,\nit leaves the problem of what to do with lingering config-items. The\nexpectation is that the admin that arranges for the -\u003eremove() (unbind)\nof the ${tsm_arch}-guest driver is also responsible for deletion of all\nopen config-items. Until that deletion happens, -\u003eprobe() (reload /\nbind) of the ${tsm_arch}-guest driver fails.\n\nThis allows for emergency shutdown / revocation of attestation\ninterfaces, and requires coordinated restart."
