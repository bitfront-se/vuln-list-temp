An authenticated user can exploit the Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability that may lead to unauthorized cross-tenant access (list tenant user accounts, add user account into other tenant). Unauthorized cross-tenant access: list user from other tenant (e.g., via GET /\u003ctenant_id\u003e/user/list), add user account to other tenant (POST /\u003ctenant_id\u003e/user). This issue has not yet been patched. Users are advised to reach out to the project maintainers to coordinate a fix."
