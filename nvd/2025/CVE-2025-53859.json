This issue happens during the NGINX SMTP authentication process and requires the attacker to make preparations against the target system to extract the leaked data. The issue affects NGINX only if (1) it is built with the ngx_mail_smtp_module, (2) the smtp_auth directive is configured with method \"none,\" and (3) the authentication server returns the \"Auth-Wait\" response header.\n\n\n\n\nNote: Software versions which have reached End of Technical Support (EoTS) are not evaluated."
