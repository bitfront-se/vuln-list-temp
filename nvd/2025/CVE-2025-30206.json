          "value": "Dpanel is a Docker visualization panel system which provides complete Docker management functions. The Dpanel service contains a hardcoded JWT secret in its default configuration, allowing attackers to generate valid JWT tokens and compromise the host machine. This security flaw allows attackers to analyze the source code, discover the embedded secret, and craft legitimate JWT tokens. By forging these tokens, an attacker can successfully bypass authentication mechanisms, impersonate privileged users, and gain unauthorized administrative access. Consequently, this enables full control over the host machine, potentially leading to severe consequences such as sensitive data exposure, unauthorized command execution, privilege escalation, or further lateral movement within the network environment. This issue is patched in version 1.6.1. A workaround for this vulnerability involves replacing the hardcoded secret with a securely generated value and load it from secure configuration storage."
