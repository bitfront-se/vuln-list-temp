And turns out this behaviour exist since\nblk-wbt is introduced.\n\nOther than REQ_IDLE, other flags should not be ignored as well, for\nexample REQ_META can be set for filesystems, clearing it can cause priority\nreverse problems; And REQ_NOWAIT should not be cleared as well, because\nio will wait instead of failing directly in underlying disks.\n\nFix those problems by keep IO flags from master bio.\n\nFises: f51d46d0e7cb (\"md: add support for REQ_NOWAIT\")"
