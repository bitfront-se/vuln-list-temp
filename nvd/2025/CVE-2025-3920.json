These credentials correspond to a built-in administrative account of the software. An attacker with local access to the system or the application's installation directory could extract these credentials, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the application's administrative functions.Â This issue was fixed in version 2025.03.27 of the SUR-FBD CMMS software."
