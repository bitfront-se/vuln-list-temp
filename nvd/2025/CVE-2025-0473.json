This vulnerability exists in the file upload functionality on the ‘/pmb/authorities/import/iimport_authorities’ endpoint. When a file is uploaded via this resource, the server will create a temporary file that will be deleted after the client sends a POST request to ‘/pmb/authorities/import/iimport_authorities’. This workflow is automated by the web client, however an attacker can trap and launch the second POST request to prevent the temporary file from being deleted."
