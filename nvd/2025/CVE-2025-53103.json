The impact depends on the level of the access token exposed through the OpenTestReportGeneratingListener. If these test reports are published or stored anywhere public, then there is the possibility that a rouge attacker can steal the token and perform elevated actions by impersonating the user or app. This issue as been patched in version 5.13.2."
