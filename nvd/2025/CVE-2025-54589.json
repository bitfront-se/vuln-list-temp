This field appends a filter parameter to the URL, which reflects its value directly into a `\u003cscript\u003e` block without proper escaping, allowing for reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and can be exploited against both authenticated and unauthenticated users. This is fixed in version 1.18.7."
