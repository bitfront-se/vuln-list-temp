The code dynamically replaces placeholder tokens (e.g., \u003c|audio_|\u003e, \u003c|image_|\u003e) with repeated tokens based on precomputed lengths. Due to ??inefficient list concatenation operations??, the algorithm exhibits ??quadratic time complexity (O(n²))??, allowing malicious actors to trigger resource exhaustion via specially crafted inputs. This issue has been patched in version 0.8.5."
