It lacks authentication controls on its HTTP and RTSP interfaces, allowing attackers to retrieve sensitive files and video recordings. By connecting to http://192.168.10.1/mnt/extsd/event/, an attacker can download all stored video recordings in an unencrypted manner. Additionally, the RTSP stream on port 8554 is accessible without authentication, allowing an attacker to view live footage."
