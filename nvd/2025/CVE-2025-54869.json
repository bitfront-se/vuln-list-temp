In versions 2.6.2 and below, any application that uses FPDI to process user-supplied PDF files is at risk, causing a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability. An attacker can upload a small, malicious PDF file that will cause the server-side script to crash due to memory exhaustion. Repeated attacks can lead to sustained service unavailability. This issue is fixed in version 2.6.3."
