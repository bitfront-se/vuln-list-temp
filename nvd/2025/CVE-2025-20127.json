An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of TLS 1.3 connections with the specific TLS 1.3 Cipher TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition where no new incoming encrypted connections are accepted. The device must be reloaded to clear this condition.\r\nNote: These incoming TLS 1.3 connections include both data traffic and user-management traffic. After the device is in the vulnerable state, no new encrypted connections can be accepted."
