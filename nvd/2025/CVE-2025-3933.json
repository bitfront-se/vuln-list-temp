This vulnerability affects versions 4.50.3 and earlier, and is fixed in version 4.52.1. The issue arises from the regex pattern `\u003cs_(.*?)\u003e` which can be exploited to cause excessive CPU consumption through crafted input strings due to catastrophic backtracking. This vulnerability can lead to service disruption, resource exhaustion, and potential API service vulnerabilities, impacting document processing tasks using the Donut model."
