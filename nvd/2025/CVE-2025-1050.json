This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected Sonos Era 300 speakers. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. \n\nThe specific flaw exists within the processing of HLS playlist data. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated data structure. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the anacapa user. Was ZDI-CAN-25606."
