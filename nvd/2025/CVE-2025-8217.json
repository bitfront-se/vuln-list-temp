The code executes when the extension is launched within the VS Code environment; however the injected code contains a syntax error which prevents it from making a successful API call to the Q Developer CLI.\n\n\n\nTo mitigate this issue, users should upgrade to version v1.85.0. All installations of v1.84.0 should be removed from use."
