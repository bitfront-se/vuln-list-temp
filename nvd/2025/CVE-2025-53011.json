In version 1.39.2, when parsing shader nodes in a MTLX file, the MaterialXCore code accesses a potentially null pointer, which can lead to crashes with maliciously crafted files. An attacker could intentionally crash a target program that uses MaterialX by sending a malicious MTLX file. This is fixed in version 1.39.3."
