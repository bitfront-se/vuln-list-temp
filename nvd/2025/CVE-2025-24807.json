Prior to versions 2.6.10, 2.10.7, 2.14.5, 3.0.2, 3.1.2, and 3.2.0, per design, PermissionsCA is not full chain validated, nor is the expiration date validated. Access control plugin validates only the S/MIME signature which causes an expired PermissionsCA to be taken as valid. Even though this issue is responsible for allowing `governance/permissions` from an expired PermissionsCA and having the system crash when PermissionsCA is not self-signed and contains the full-chain, the impact is low. Versions 2.6.10, 2.10.7, 2.14.5, 3.0.2, 3.1.2, and 3.2.0 contain a fix for the issue."
