This affects the function remove of the file novel-admin/src/main/java/com/java2nb/common/controller/FileController.java of the component File Handler. The manipulation leads to improper control of resource identifiers. It is possible to initiate the attack remotely. The complexity of an attack is rather high. The exploitability is told to be difficult. The exploit has been disclosed to the public and may be used. The vendor was contacted early about this disclosure but did not respond in any way."
