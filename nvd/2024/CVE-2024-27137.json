The attacker can \nthen use these credentials to access the JMX interface and perform \nunauthorized operations.\n\n\nThis is same vulnerability that CVE-2020-13946 was issued for, but the Java option was changed in JDK10.\n\n\nThis issue affects Apache Cassandra from 4.0.2 through 5.0.2 running Java 11.\n\n\nOperators are recommended to upgrade to a release equal to or later than 4.0.15, 4.1.8, or 5.0.3 which fixes the issue."
