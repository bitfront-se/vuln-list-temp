If successful, the actor could inject persistent JavaScript payloads, enabling the theft of user data or execution of unauthorized actions on behalf of other users.\n\nWhile this issue enables persistent client-side script execution, session-related cookies remain protected with the httpOnly flag, preventing session hijacking."
