This can lead to multiple security issues including denial of service, stored XSS, and information disclosure. The affected endpoints are '/v1/share/{id:str}' for uploading and '/v1/share/{id:str}' for downloading JSON files. The lack of authentication allows any user to upload and overwrite files, potentially causing the S3 bucket to run out of space, injecting malicious scripts, and accessing sensitive information."
