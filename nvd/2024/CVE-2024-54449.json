This can be used to facilitate RCE. An account with ‘read’ and ‘write’ privileges on at least one existing document in the application is required to exploit the vulnerability. Exploitation of this vulnerability would allow an attacker to run commands of their choosing on the underlying operating system of the web server running LogicalDOC."
