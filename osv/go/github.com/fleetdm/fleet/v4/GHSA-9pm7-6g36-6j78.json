  "summary": "Fleet: Unauthenticated Android device disenrollment vulnerability via Pub/Sub endpoint ",
  "details": "### Summary\n\nA vulnerability in Fleet’s Android MDM Pub/Sub handling could allow unauthenticated requests to trigger device unenrollment events. This may result in unauthorized removal of individual Android devices from Fleet management.\n\n### Impact\n\nIf Android MDM is enabled, an attacker could send a crafted request to the Android Pub/Sub endpoint to unenroll a targeted Android device from Fleet without authentication.\n\nThis issue does not grant access to Fleet, allow execution of commands, or provide visibility into device data. Impact is limited to disruption of Android device management for the affected device.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf an immediate upgrade is not possible, affected Fleet users should temporarily disable Android MDM.\n\n### For more information\n\nIf there any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\nEmail Fleet at [security@fleetdm.com](mailto:security@fleetdm.com)\nJoin #fleet in [osquery Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/osquery/shared_invite/zt-h29zm0gk-s2DBtGUTW4CFel0f0IjTEw)\n\n### Credits\n\nFleet thanks @secfox-ai for responsibly reporting this issue.",
