  "summary": "EVE Doesn't Protect Config Partition with Measured Boot",
  "details": "### Impact\nConfig partition measurement was moved from PCR 13 to PCR 14 in a commit, but PCR 14 was not added to the list of PCRs that seal/unseal the vault key. As a result, an attacker can remove the disk, use another server to modify the files in the config partition, and then re-insert the disk.\n\n### Patches\n\nFixed in EVE version 9.4.3-lts\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNone (apart from preventing physical access to the device)\n\n### Resources\n\nhttps://help.zededa.com/hc/en-us/articles/43295940828827-TPM-PCR-Index-Security-Implications\nhttps://github.com/lf-edge/eve/commit/d9383a7ee4e1c39f5c8c6d4a63cb2ebd00695e8a",
