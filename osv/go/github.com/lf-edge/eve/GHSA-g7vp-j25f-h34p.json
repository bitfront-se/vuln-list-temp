  "summary": "EVE Has Partially Predetermined Vault Key",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nThe deriveVaultKey function calls retrieveCloudKey which always returns \"foobarfoobarfoobarfoobarfoobarfo\". When merged with the randomly generated 32-byte key using mergeKeys (16 bytes from each), the last 16 bytes are always \"arfoobarfoobarfo\". This enables an attacker with physical access to the EVE-OS device to attempt to brute force the remaining 128 bits of key.\n\n### Patches\n\nFixed in 7.10 and  8.12.1-lts\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNone",
