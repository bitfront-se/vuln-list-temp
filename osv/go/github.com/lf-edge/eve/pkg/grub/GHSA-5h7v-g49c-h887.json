  "summary": "EVE Doesn't Protect Rootfs",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nMeasured boot validates BIOS, grub, kernel cmdline, and initrd but not the entire rootfs. Thus, an attacker can create an EVE-OS rootfs squashfs image with some files modified and take out the disk and replace the existing rootfs image without that being detected by measure boot and remote attestation.\n\n### Patches\n\nFixed in 8.6.0 and 8.12.1-lts\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNone",
