  "summary": "Blocklist Bypass possible via ECDSA Signature Malleability",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nWhen using P256 certificates (which is not the default configuration), it is possible to evade a blocklist entry created against the fingerprint of a certificate by using ECDSA Signature Malleability to use a copy of the certificate with a different fingerprint.\n\nIn order for this to affect a user or network, all of the following must be true:\n* `CURVE_P256` certificates are being used\n* There are one or more entries on the blocklist\n* The certificates for those entries are signed by a trusted CA and not expired\n* An attacker has a copy of the private key, and corresponding certificate, for one of those blocklist entries\n\n### Patches\n\nSee attached\n\n### Workarounds\n\nIf full copies of each certificate on the existing blocklist are available, it is possible to compute their opposite-chirality signature, and then the appropriate second fingerprint to list in the blocklist.\n\nRotating out all CAs that have signed hosts on the blocklist will also prevent exploitation of this vulnerability.",
