  "summary": "osctrl is Vulnerable to OS Command Injection via Environment Configuration",
  "details": "### Summary\nAn OS command injection vulnerability exists in the `osctrl-admin` environment configuration. An authenticated administrator can inject arbitrary shell commands via the hostname parameter when creating or editing environments. These commands are embedded into enrollment one-liner scripts generated using Go's `text/template` package (which does not perform shell escaping) and execute on every endpoint that enrolls using the compromised environment.\n\n### Impact\nAn attacker with administrator access can achieve remote code execution on every endpoint that enrolls using the compromised environment. Commands execute as root/SYSTEM (the privilege level used for osquery enrollment) before osquery is installed, leaving no agent-level audit trail. This enables backdoor installation, credential exfiltration, and full endpoint compromise.\n\n### Patches\nFixed in osctrl `v0.5.0`. Users should upgrade immediately.\n\n### Workarounds\nRestrict osctrl administrator access to trusted personnel. Review existing environment configurations for suspicious hostnames. Monitor enrollment scripts for unexpected commands.\n\n### Credits\n\nLeon Johnson and Kwangyun Keum from TikTok USDS JV Offensive Security Operations (Offensive Privacy Team)\n\nhttps://github.com/Kwangyun → @Kwangyun\nhttps://github.com/sho-luv → @sho-luv",
