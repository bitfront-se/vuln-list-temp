  "summary": "melange pipeline working-directory could allow command injection",
  "details": "An attacker who can provide build input values, but not modify pipeline definitions, could execute arbitrary shell commands if the pipeline uses `${{vars.*}}` or `${{inputs.*}}` substitutions in `working-directory`. The field is embedded into shell scripts without proper quote escaping.\n\n**Fix:** Fixed with [e51ca30c](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/melange/commit/e51ca30cfb63178f5a86997d23d3fff0359fa6c8), Released. \n\n**Acknowledgements**\n\nmelange thanks Oleh Konko from [1seal](https://1seal.org/) for discovering and reporting this issue.",
