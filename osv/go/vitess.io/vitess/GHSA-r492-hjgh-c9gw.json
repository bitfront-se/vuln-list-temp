  ],
  "summary": "Vitess users with backup storage access can write to arbitrary file paths on restore",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nAnyone with read/write access to the backup storage location (e.g. an S3 bucket) can manipulate backup manifest files so that files in the manifest — which may be files that they have also added to the manifest and backup contents — are written to any accessible location on restore. This is a common [Path Traversal](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal) security issue. This can be used to provide that attacker with unintended/unauthorized access to the production deployment environment — allowing them to access information available in that environment as well as run any additional arbitrary commands there.\n\n### Patches\n\nv23.0.3 and v22.0.4\n\n### Resources\n\nhttps://github.com/vitessio/vitess/pull/19470",
