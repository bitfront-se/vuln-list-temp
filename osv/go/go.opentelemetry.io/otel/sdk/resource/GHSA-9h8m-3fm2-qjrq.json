  "summary": "OpenTelemetry Go SDK Vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution via PATH Hijacking",
  "details": "### Impact\nThe OpenTelemetry Go SDK in version `v1.20.0`-`1.39.0` is vulnerable to Path Hijacking (Untrusted Search Paths) on macOS/Darwin systems. The resource detection code in `sdk/resource/host_id.go` executes the `ioreg` system command using a search path. An attacker with the ability to locally modify the PATH environment variable can achieve Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE) within the context of the application.\n\n### Patches\nThis has been patched in [d45961b](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go/commit/d45961bcda453fcbdb6469c22d6e88a1f9970a53), which was released with `v1.40.0`.\n\n### References\n- [CWE-426: Untrusted Search Path](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/426.html)",
