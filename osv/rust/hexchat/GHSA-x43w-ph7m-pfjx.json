  "summary": "hexchat crate has a Use After Free vulnerability",
  "details": "All versions of this crate have function `deregister_command` which can result in use after free. This is unsound.\n\nIn addition, all versions since 0.3.0 have \"safe\" macros, which are documented as unsafe to use in threads.\n\nIn addition, the `hexchat` crate is no longer actively maintained.  If users rely on this crate, consider switching to an alternative.",
