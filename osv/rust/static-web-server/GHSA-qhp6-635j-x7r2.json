  "summary": "Static Web Server affected by timing-based username enumeration in Basic Authentication due to early response on invalid usernames",
  "details": "## Summary\n\nA Timing-based username enumeration in Basic Authentication vulnerability due to early response on invalid usernames could allow attackers to identify valid users and focus their efforts on targeted brute-force or credential-stuffing attacks.\n\n## Details\n\nSWS validates the provided username before performing any password verification.\n- **Invalid Username:** The server returns a `401 Unauthorized` response immediately.\n- **Valid Username:** The server proceeds to verify the password (e.g., using `bcrypt`), which introduces a different execution path and measurable timing discrepancy.\n\nThis allows an attacker to distinguish between existing and non-existing accounts by analyzing response times.\n\n## PoC\n\nThe following statistical results were obtained by measuring the mean response time over 100 iterations using a custom Rust script:\n\n| User Type | Average Response Time |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Invalid User** | 0.409861 ms |\n| **Valid User** | 0.250925 ms |\n| **Difference** | **~0.158936 ms** |\n\nWhile the valid user responded faster in this specific test environment, the statistically significant gap confirms that the authentication logic does not execute in constant time.\n\n## Impact\n\nUsers using the SWS' Basic Authentication feature are primarily impacted.",
