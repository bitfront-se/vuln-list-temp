  "summary": "Segmentation fault and invalid memory read in `mnl::cb_run`",
  "details": "The function `mnl::cb_run` is marked as safe but exhibits unsound behavior when processing malformed Netlink message buffers.\n\nPassing a crafted byte slice to `mnl::cb_run` can trigger memory violations. The function does not sufficiently validate the input buffer structure before processing, leading to out-of-bounds reads.\n\nThis vulnerability allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (segmentation fault) or potentially read unmapped memory by providing a malformed Netlink message.\n\nThe underlying issue is a bug in `libmnl` where during validation `nlh-\u003enlmsg_len` is cast to an `int` and becomes negative if `nlmsg_len` is greater than `INT_MAX`. This causes the validation to succeed even if the buffer is too small for the message. This has been fixed in `libmnl` but still affects version 1.0.5.\n\nThe issue in `mnl` was fixed in commit `cd51bdc` by checking the validity of netlink messages passed to `mnl::cb_run`.",
