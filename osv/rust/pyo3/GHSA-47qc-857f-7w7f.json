  "summary": "PyO3 has type confusion when accessing data from sublasses of subclasses of native types with `abi3` feature",
  "details": "PyO3 0.28.1 added support for `#[pyclass(extends=PyList)] struct NativeSub` (and other native types) when targeting Python 3.12 and up with the `abi3` feature.\n\nIt was discovered that subclasses of such classes would use the type of the subclass when attempting to access to data of `NativeSub` contained within Python objects, amounting to memory corruption.\n\nPyO3 0.28.2 fixed the issue by using the type of (e.g.) `NativeSub` correctly.",
