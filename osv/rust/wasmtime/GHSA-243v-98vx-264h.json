  "summary": "Wasmtime can panic when adding excessive fields to a `wasi:http/types.fields` instance",
  "details": "### Impact\n\nWasmtime's implementation of the `wasi:http/types.fields` resource is susceptible to panics when too many fields are added to the set of headers. Wasmtime's implementation in the `wasmtime-wasi-http` crate is backed by a data structure which panics when it reaches excessive capacity and this condition was not handled gracefully in Wasmtime. Panicking in a WASI implementation is a Denial of Service vector for embedders and is treated as a security vulnerability in Wasmtime.\n\n### Patches\n\nWasmtime 24.0.6, 36.0.6, 40.0.4, 41.0.4, and 42.0.0 patch this vulnerability and return a trap to the guest instead of panicking.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThere are no known workarounds at this time, embedders are encouraged to update to a patched version of Wasmtime.\n\n### Resources\n\n* [Limitations of `http::HeaderMap`](https://docs.rs/http/1.4.0/http/header/#limitations)",
