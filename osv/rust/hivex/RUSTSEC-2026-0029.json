  "summary": "Double-free and use-after-free for Hive",
  "details": "`Drop` implementation for `Hive` did perform free, but so did `Hive::close`, which,\nat the end of the scope performed `Drop`, therefore triggering double-free.\n\nAdditionally, function `Hive::from_handle` was not marked as unsafe, making it,\nin combination with `as_handle` easy to clone and trigger double-free in safe\ncode or triggering UB when using invalid pointer.",
