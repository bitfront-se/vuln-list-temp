  "summary": "rPGP's integrity protection of encrypted data was not always checked",
  "details": "### Summary\nFor some messages, rPGP returned incorrectly decrypted data without signaling that integrity protection was invalid.\n\n### Details\nWhen decrypting SEIPD (Symmetrically Encrypted and Integrity Protected Data Packet), rPGP previously did not under all circumstances report the absence of valid integrity protection to callers of the library.\n\n### Impact\nWhile the resulting invalid decryption output is not attacker controlled, its contents may be a security concern if an attacker can gain access to it.\n\n### Attribution\nDiscovered internally in the course of rPGP development work.",
