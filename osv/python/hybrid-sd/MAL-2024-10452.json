Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research \u0026 co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n - typosquatting\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (86e0b0bb9efa9e38916bcec9d1b6335230de7dd7253b5d450cfaa3d6eddd235a)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'hybrid-sd' @ 912.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n",
