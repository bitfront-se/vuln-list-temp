When importing the module, the embedded archive is run as a module. Code inside extracts the executable and saves it to a temporary file. Further the code keeps an open file handler and removes the original file, effectively making the impression the file no longer exists. Using the file handler the executable (which is either a native Python module or was created from Python code) is run. Further behavior is not known.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: MALICIOUS - The campaign has clearly malicious intent, like infostealers.\n\n\nCampaign: 2026-02-lyroxpy\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - obfuscation\n\n\n - covering-tracks\n",
