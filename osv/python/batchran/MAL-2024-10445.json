It has a limited risk.\n - typosquatting\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (54812f0ff9d7ef156bc34dda479dabee551c6c88d9044ec701b39ba3e32b782d)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'batchran' @ 912.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n",
