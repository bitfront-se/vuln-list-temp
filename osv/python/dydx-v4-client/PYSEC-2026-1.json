  "details": "A PyPI user account compromised by an attacker and was able to\nupload a malicious version (1.1.5.post1) of the `dydx-v4-client` package.\nThis version contains a highly obfuscated multi-stage loader\nthat ultimately executes malicious code on the host system.\n\nWhile the final payload is not visible because it is tucked away inside 100 layers of encoding, \nthe structural design—specifically the use of recursive decompression followed by an `exec()` call\nis a definitive indicator of malicious software,\nlikely a \"Crypter\" or \"Dropper\" masquerading as a cryptocurrency-related utility.\nwith the intent on connecting to hxxps://dydx.priceoracle.site/py\nto download and execute further payloads.\n\nUsers of the `dydx-v4-client` package should immediately uninstall version 1.1.5.post1\nand revert to the last known good version (1.1.5) or later secure versions once available.\nAdditionally, users should monitor their systems for any unusual activity\nand consider running security scans to detect any potential compromise.\n",
