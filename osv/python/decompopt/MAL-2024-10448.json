There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research \u0026 co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n - typosquatting\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (afd6ea9666bf6ceb788814bf97d1d4e04d9d20bc715624d139e2da921b61c2d5)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'decompopt' @ 912.6 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n",
