  "summary": "Indico Affected by Cross-Site-Scripting via material uploads",
  "details": "### Impact\nThere is a Cross-Site-Scripting vulnerability when uploading certain file types as materials.\n\n### Patches\nYou should to update to [Indico 3.3.10](https://github.com/indico/indico/releases/tag/v3.3.10) as soon as possible.\nSee [the docs](https://docs.getindico.io/en/stable/installation/upgrade/) for instructions on how to update.\n\nPlease be aware that to apply the fix itself updating is sufficient, but to benefit from the strict Content-Security-Policy we now apply by default for file downloads, you need to update your webserver config in case you use nginx with Indico's `STATIC_FILE_METHOD` set to `xaccelredirect` and add the following line to the `.xsf/indico/` location block (you can consult the Indico setup documentation for the full configuration snippet):\n\n```nginx\nadd_header Content-Security-Policy $upstream_http_content_security_policy;\n```\n\n### Workarounds\n- Use your webserver config to apply a strict CSP for material download endpoints.\n- Only let trustworthy users create content (including material uploads, which speakers can typically do as well) on Indico.\n\n### For more information\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n\n- Open a thread in [our forum](https://talk.getindico.io/)\n- Email us privately at [indico-team@cern.ch](mailto:indico-team@cern.ch)",
