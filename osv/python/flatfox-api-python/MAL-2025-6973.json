It has a limited risk.\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (d82a5bf63c0c510997a6d8d438e71f8522351b6e4c0cbca760d856ef2b623342)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'flatfox-api-python' @ 0.3 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n\n- The package executes one or more commands associated with malicious behavior.\n",
