It has a limited risk.\n - typosquatting\n - dependency-confusion\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (72d7f8fc3a75036a65efb8bfa775e288fca63ae4201506ac9f8505fee566413d)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'macaqua' @ 99.7 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n",
