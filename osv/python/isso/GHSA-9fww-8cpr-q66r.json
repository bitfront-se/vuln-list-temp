  "summary": "Isso affected by Stored XSS via comment website field",
  "details": "## Impact\n\nThis is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting the website and author comment fields. The website field was HTML-escaped using quote=False, which left single and double quotes unescaped. Since the frontend inserts the website value directly into a single-quoted href attribute via string concatenation, a single quote in the URL breaks out of the attribute context, allowing injection of arbitrary event handlers (e.g. onmouseover, onclick).\n\nThe same escaping was missing entirely from the user-facing comment edit endpoint (PUT /id/\u003cid\u003e) and the moderation edit endpoint (POST /id/\u003cid\u003e/edit/\u003ckey\u003e).\n\nAny visitor to a page embedding isso comments is impacted. No authentication or interaction beyond mouse movement is required to trigger a payload — an attacker can post a comment anonymously (moderation is off by default) with a crafted website URL, and the payload persists in the database and fires on every page load. With the full-page invisible overlay technique described in the report, the victim only needs to move their mouse.\n\n## Patches\n\nThe issue is fixed in commit 3cf27c2. Users should upgrade to a version containing that commit once released. The fix applies html.escape(..., quote=True) to the website field across all three write paths (POST /new, PUT /id/\u003cid\u003e, POST /id/\u003cid\u003e/edit/\u003ckey\u003e), and adds input validation and escaping to the moderation edit endpoint which previously had neither.\n\n## Workarounds\n\n  Enabling comment moderation (moderation = enabled = true in isso.cfg) prevents unauthenticated users from publishing comments, raising the bar for exploitation. However, it\n  does not fully mitigate the issue since a moderator activating a malicious comment would still expose visitors. There is no configuration-only workaround that fully prevents\n   the vulnerability.\n\n## Resources\n\n  - https://docs.python.org/3/library/html.html#html.escape — note the quote parameter",
