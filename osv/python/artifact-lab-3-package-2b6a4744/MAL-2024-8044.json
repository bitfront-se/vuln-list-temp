Most probably experiments. Later versions moved to use Burp Collaborator to exfiltrate simple data. Pentest? An artifact from some red team curse?\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: MALICIOUS - The campaign has clearly malicious intent, like infostealers.\nCampaign: 2024-08-lab-artifacts-revshell\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n - The package contains code to create a reverse shell, allowing an attacker to execute any commands on the victim's machine.\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n - The package overrides the install command in setup.py to execute malicious code during installation.\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (9b971d40eca1cceb8d27177313771f0e256bd017027471a0b6cbddebd9ed0687)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'artifact-lab-3-package-2b6a4744' @ 0.3.1 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n",
