However, there is also undisclosed malicious behavior:\n\n1. The package installs a .pth file directly in the site-packages directory, effectively running a special code on each Python usage.\n2. This code performs \"TLS context warm-up\" by contacting a URL (Github) in the background, in a separate process; this is suspicious on its own as it's unclear how a separate process can warm up further requests in the main process, but...\n3. ...besides the URL given in the code above, the library always contacts a hardcoded URL, identifying itself as a VPN client.\n\nAdditionally, there is no source code of the modified library anywhere, and the related Github hosting the package code account is 1-day old.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: MALICIOUS - The campaign has clearly malicious intent, like infostealers.\n\n\nCampaign: 2026-02-ctf-toolkit\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n",
