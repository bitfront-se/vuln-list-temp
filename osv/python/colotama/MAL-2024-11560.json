It's attached to the __init__ of EmojiConverter class. Other related packages utilize a typosquatting to imitate real packages, and attempts to call the EmojiConverter from pyprettifier, triggering notifying the author about the user's home path.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research \u0026 co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\nCampaign: 2024-09-pyprettifier\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n - typosquatting\n - The malicious code is intentionally included in a dependency of the package\n - action-hidden-in-lib-usage\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n\n## Source: ossf-package-analysis (18c9d3a75d7d00423b531ffce7bf8ecbe34e723046045707f3ce1bd6043255fe)\nThe OpenSSF Package Analysis project identified 'colotama' @ 0.4.8 (pypi) as malicious.\n\nIt is considered malicious because:\n\n- The package communicates with a domain associated with malicious activity.\n",
