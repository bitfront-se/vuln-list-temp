The decrypted command attempted to download and execute code from hxxps://or-6.github[.]io, which at the time of analysis didn't host any code.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: MALICIOUS - The campaign has clearly malicious intent, like infostealers.\n\n\nCampaign: 2026-01-uitil\n\n\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n\n\n - typosquatting\n\n\n - steganography\n\n\n - The malicious code is intentionally included in a dependency of the package\n\n\n - action-hidden-in-lib-usage\n\n\n - The package contains code to execute remote commands (probably limited to a specific set) on the victim's machine.\n",
