  "summary": "Ray dashboard DELETE endpoints allow unauthenticated browser-triggered DoS (Serve shutdown / job deletion)",
  "details": "### Summary\n\n  Ray’s dashboard HTTP server blocks browser-origin POST/PUT but does not cover DELETE, and key DELETE endpoints are unauthenticated by default. If the dashboard/agent is reachable (e.g., --dashboard-host=0.0.0.0), a web page via DNS rebinding or same-network access can\n  issue DELETE requests that shut down Serve or delete jobs without user interaction. This is a drive-by availability impact.\n\n  ### Details\n\n  - Middleware: python/ray/dashboard/http_server_head.py#get_browsers_no_post_put_middleware only checks POST/PUT via is_browser_request (UA/Origin/Sec-Fetch heuristics). DELETE is not gated.\n  - Endpoints lacking browser protection/auth by default:\n      - python/ray/dashboard/modules/serve/serve_head.py: @routes.delete(\"/api/serve/applications/\") calls serve.shutdown().\n      - python/ray/dashboard/modules/job/job_head.py: @routes.delete(\"/api/jobs/{job_or_submission_id}\").\n      - python/ray/dashboard/modules/job/job_agent.py: @routes.delete(\"/api/job_agent/jobs/{job_or_submission_id}\") (not wrapped with deny_browser_requests either).\n  - Dashboard token auth is optional and off by default; binding to 0.0.0.0 is common for remote access.\n\n  ### PoC\n\n  Prereqs: dashboard reachable (e.g., ray start --head --dashboard-host=0.0.0.0), no token auth.\n\n  1. Start Serve (or have jobs present).\n  2. From any browser-reachable origin (DNS rebinding or same-LAN page), issue a DELETE fetch:\n\n```  \nfetch(\"http://\u003cdashboard-host\u003e:8265/api/serve/applications/\", {\n    method: \"DELETE\",\n    headers: { \"User-Agent\": \"Mozilla/5.0\" }  // browsers set this automatically\n  });\n```\n\n  Result: Serve shuts down.\n  3) Similarly, delete jobs:\n\n ` fetch(\"http://\u003cdashboard-host\u003e:8265/api/jobs/\u003cjob_or_submission_id\u003e\", { method: \"DELETE\" });`\n ` fetch(\"http://\u003cdashboard-agent\u003e:52365/api/job_agent/jobs/\u003cjob_or_submission_id\u003e\", { method: \"DELETE\" });`\n\n  Browsers will send the Mozilla UA and Origin/Sec-Fetch headers, but DELETE is not blocked by the middleware, so the requests succeed.\n\n  ### Impact\n\n  - Availability loss: Serve shutdown; job deletion. Triggerable via drive-by browser requests if the dashboard/agent ports are reachable and auth is disabled (default).\n  - No code execution from this vector, but breaks isolation/trust assumptions for “developer-only” endpoints.\n  \n### Fix\nThe fix for this vulnerability is to update to Ray 2.54.0 or higher. \n\nFix PR: https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/60526",
