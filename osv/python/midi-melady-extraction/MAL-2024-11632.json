Installing the package or importing the module triggers reporting basic info like hostname, path and the username to the package author. There is no other purpose of the package.\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: PROBABLY_PENTEST - Packages looking like typical pentest packages, but also anything that looks like testing, exploring pre-prepared kits, research \u0026 co, with clearly low-harm possibilities.\nCampaign: 2024-11-byted-dast\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n - The package contains code to exfiltrate basic data from the system, like IP or username. It has a limited risk.\n - typosquatting\n - dependency-confusion\n",
