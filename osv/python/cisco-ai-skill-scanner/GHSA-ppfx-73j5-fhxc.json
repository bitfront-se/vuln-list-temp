  "summary": "Skill-scanner Unsecured Network Binding Vulnerability",
  "details": "**Description:**\nA vulnerability in the API Server of Skill Scanner could allow a unauthenticated, remote attacker to interact with the server API and either trigger a denial of service (DoS) condition or upload arbitrary files.\n\nThis vulnerability is due to an erroneous binding to multiple interfaces. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending API requests to a device exposing the affected API Server. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to consume an excessive amount of resources (memory starvation) or to upload files to arbitrary folders on the affected device.\n\n**Conditions:**\nThis vulnerability affects Skill-scanner 1.0.1 and earlier releases when the API Server is enabled. The API Server is not enabled by default.\n\n**Fixed Software:**\nSkill-scanner software releases 1.0.2 and later contained the fix for this vulnerability.\n\n**For more information:**\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n- [Open an issue in cisco-ai-defense/skill-scanner](https://github.com/cisco-ai-defense/skill-scanner/issues)\n- Email Cisco Open Source Security ([oss-security@cisco.com](mailto:oss-security@cisco.com)) and Cisco PSIRT ([psirt@cisco.com](mailto:psirt@cisco.com))\n\n**Credits:**\n\n- Research: Richard Tweed (@RichardoC)\n- Fix ideation and implementation: Richard Tweed (@RichardoC)\n- Release engineering: Vineeth Sai Narajala (@vineethsai7)",
