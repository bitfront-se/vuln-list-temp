There are also variations with AWS clients\n\nApparently, the campaign started at least 2 years ago with the snapshot-photo package containing the same functionality as the newer time-check-server (see https://github.com/pypi-data/pypi-mirror-238/blob/code/packages/snapshot-photo/snapshot_photo-0.0.3-py3-none-any.whl/snapshot_photo/date_format.py).\n\n\n---\n\nCategory: MALICIOUS - The campaign has clearly malicious intent, like infostealers.\nCampaign: 2025-02-alicloud-client\nReasons (based on the campaign):\n - clones_real_package\n - action-hidden-in-lib-usage\n - The malicious code is intentionally included in a dependency of the package\n - exfiltration_cloud_tokens\n",
