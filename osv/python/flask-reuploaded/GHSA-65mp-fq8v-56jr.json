  "summary": "Flask-Reuploaded vulnerable to Remote Code Execution via Server-Side Template Injection",
  "details": "### Impact\nA critical path traversal and extension bypass vulnerability in Flask-Reuploaded allows remote attackers to achieve arbitrary file write and remote code execution through Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI).\n\n### Patches\nFlask-Reuploaded has been patched in version 1.5.0\n\n### Workarounds\n\n1. **Do not pass user input to the `name` parameter**\n2. Use auto-generated filenames only\n3. Implement strict input validation if `name` must be used\n\n```python\nfrom werkzeug.utils import secure_filename\nimport os\n\n# Sanitize user input before passing to save()\nsafe_name = secure_filename(request.form.get('custom_name'))\n# Remove path separators\nsafe_name = os.path.basename(safe_name)\n# Validate extension matches policy\nif not photos.extension_allowed(photos.get_extension(safe_name)):\n    abort(400)\n    \nfilename = photos.save(file, name=safe_name)\n```\n\n### Resources\nThe fix is documented in the pull request, see https://github.com/jugmac00/flask-reuploaded/pull/180.\n\nA proper write-up was created by the reporter of the vulnerability, Jaron Cabral (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaron-cabral-751994357/), but is not yet available as of time of this publication.",
